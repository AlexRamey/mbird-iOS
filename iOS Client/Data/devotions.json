    "text": "<p>The Italian novelist Cesare Pavese once said, \u201cThe only joy in the world is to begin.\u201d A newborn baby is a fitting example. So is the clean-slate feeling that comes on New Year\u2019s Day.</p><p>Experience goes to show, however, that any sense of newness usually lasts as long as it takes to drive a new car off the lot. Babies grow older. January turns to February in the blink of an eye. In this sense, Christian joy is unlike any other kind of joy. It is the only thing that lets us truly say the old is gone forever; the new has come, and it\u2019s come to stay. How can this be?</p><p/>The Bible makes perfectly clear that God is not in the business of self-betterment, but of death and resurrection. Christianity is not a lifelong program to make you a better person, but the proclamation that Jesus entered into the ultimate ending, death, in order to give you the ultimate beginning, eternal life. Through Jesus, your fresh start\u2014your \u201cnew you\u201d\u2014began in a manger. It was established on a cross and fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Now and forever.</p><p>Of course, we experience this truth in a constant cycle. Life is full of beginnings and endings. Every joy that \u201ccomes in the morning,\u201d however, is an echo of that blessed Easter morning, when Jesus began his reign that will last forevermore.</p>"

And Simon and his companions hunted for him. When they found him, they said to him, \u201cEveryone is searching for you.\u201d He answered, \u201cLet us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.\u201d</p>",

Hardly anything has occurred in Mark\u2019s account before Jesus withdraws to a deserted place to pray. He takes a deliberate pause from healing the sick and casting out demons.</p><p>The pattern of modern life, on the other hand, is nonstop engagement. We cannot even enjoy the little breaks given to us at stoplights or in waiting rooms. We go from one moment to the next, never fully engaged or disengaged. Call it a culture of distraction.</p><p>Not surprisingly, distraction has become a major source of contemporary guilt\u2014just ask any parent of young children about the last time their child asked them to put down their phone.</p><p>What do you seek distraction from? Could be grief, or loneliness, or doubt, or mortality, or hunger, or guilt itself! Could be the voice of internal criticism, or anything really.</p><p>The disciples do not follow the same pattern as Christ. Their need leads them to seek out their teacher the moment he goes missing. \u201cEveryone is searching for you,\u201d they say with unintended irony.</p><p>And so they interrupt Jesus\u2019 prayers\u2014they get in the way of his time with God. Note that he does not meet them with a rebuke or with a rejection. Nor does he give them a lesson about retreat and engagement. He responds with kindness and renewed focus.</p><p>Jesus, it turns out, doesn\u2019t want to be distracted from preaching the gospel. That\u2019s where his energy lies: in spreading the news that, with mercy and love, God has interrupted\u2014and will continue to interrupt\u2014the panicked pattern of human history. That he brings rest to the weary and hope to the guilty.<br><br><i>Lord, please interrupt our distractions today with your peace, and open our ears afresh to hear your gospel of grace. Amen.</i></p>"

If I am surprised by an invitation I wasn\u2019t expecting, I balk. I hedge. I equivocate. I am not good at going with the flow.</p><p>Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is offering a new direction. And while we are to assume that his fork in the road leads travelers to greener pastures, Jesus encounters several people who have plans, thank you very much\u2014jobs to do, families to feed, duties to fulfill\u2014and can\u2019t just drop everything. <i>Blessed are the flexible</i>, yeah, sure, but tell that to my kid\u2019s violin instructor\u2026</p><p>Jesus is the Great Interrupter. He interrupts our regularly scheduled programming to bring us Yesbutters an invitation to reality. Sometimes it is a welcome invitation to let loose and enjoy the party. Other times, the reality we\u2019re being asked to face looks more like a funeral. Jesus doesn\u2019t ask that we like what\u2019s on offer, but he warns us about the perils of a life spent denying it. This is what the invitation to faith looks like on a daily basis: to accept what\u2019s real over what we\u2019d prefer to be real.</p><p>And so, a proper prayer for a Yesbutter like myself:<br><br><i>Lord, grant me the courage to yield.

Even more often, men and women have been killed as they themselves sought to kill those whom they deemed evil. But the death of Jesus is extraordinary in its solitude, pacifism, and unanimity. Jesus dies alone, willingly, peaceably, and almost everyone agrees that it\u2019s a great idea.</p><p>When we reflect on the death of Jesus, we must always remember that we are in the crowd, condoning or demanding his death with our words, actions, or silence, and that we can never possibly grasp the meaning of God\u2019s death at our hands\u2014the tear it rends in creation, and yet the redemption it somehow births, in spite of us. Each and every day, we speak and act in such a way that repudiates and rejects Jesus, and yet he died for us, and did so forgivingly. If Jesus dies for and forgives even those who execute him, our hope is assured, not because of anything we have done or might do, but only on account of his unflinching mercy.</p>"

    "author": "Bryan Jarrell",
    "text": "<p>Of all the Bible\u2019s \u201cminor\u201d prophets, Jonah\u2019s story is the best known. This renegade prophet fled from God\u2019s orders, catching a boat to the west when he had been told to travel east. God frustrates Jonah\u2019s flight with a massive storm on the sea, a storm that threatens the lives of both Jonah and the ship\u2019s crew. Once the crew realizes the storm is God\u2019s judgment on Jonah, Jonah himself volunteers to be thrown overboard to save the rest of the crew. Floating in the middle of the Mediterranean, destined to drown and die as God\u2019s AWOL prophet, Jonah is famously saved by a large fish that swallows him up and carries him to dry land.</p><p>Let\u2019s observe the fact that Jonah\u2019s three days in the belly of a fish were not part of God\u2019s punishment but of God\u2019s rescue. How odd is it that God would choose such a vessel for saving his wayward prophet! Of all the prayers recorded in the Bible, the prayer from Jonah 2 comes from the most bizarre place: the inside of a fish\u2019s belly. God delights in saving his people through the strangest of circumstances. The thing that feels like a judgment (three days in a fish\u2019s stomach doesn\u2019t sound like any sort of heavenly blessing!) is actually the saving work of God. Who would have guessed?</p><p>When it comes to the \u201cstrange ways that God saves,\u201d perhaps the only other Bible story that could rival Jonah\u2019s pescatarian salvation is the gospel itself. It\u2019s no surprise that Jesus describes his death and resurrection as \u201cthe sign of Jonah\u201d (Mt 12:39). God saves Jonah with the gulp of a large fish, and God saves the world by having Jesus Christ swallowed up by death itself. The NRSV translation graphically says Jonah was \u201cspewed\u201d upon the dry land. We could equally say that hell spewed up the risen Christ as unfit for its domain, the first of many to be rejected from the confines of Sheol.</p><p>Be on the lookout for the strange and unexpected. Perhaps the thing that looks like the judgment of God may actually be the vehicle by which God is saving you. It may not be a fish or a crucifixion, but don\u2019t write off the career troubles, family strife, or financial hardship as mere inconveniences. God has saved with much stranger things.</p>"

For the things that aren\u2019t, the act of putting them in the God box helps her detach from it, to literally put it away, trusting that if it\u2019s going to change at all, God will have to do something.</p><p>One of the perks of this activity is that, every month or two, when her box has reached full capacity, she sifts through the pieces of paper. If the prayer remains a prayer, she keeps it in the box; but if not, she pulls it out. She\u2019s told me that it is amazing to see how many prayers have been addressed, without her doing a thing.</p><p>This is just a small taste of the real \u201cGod box\u201d the psalmist alludes to here. With God, every \u201ctossing\u201d has been counted, every tear bottled up. This is commiseration at its most intimate. God is not simply the recordkeeper of all sins, the old Naughty-List Maker. He is the recordkeeper of tears. He is the one who knows, with microscopic precision, the weight you\u2019re carrying around with you today. The psalmist sings that, not only has God kept track of all your sufferings, but that he has done so to eventually mend every last one of them (v. 9).</p><p>I asked my friend: What about the pieces of paper that she can\u2019t pull out, the ones that go on, year after year, unaddressed? Do they grate on her?</p><p>Yes, she said. Of course they do. But so many have been answered that it seems foolish to think of God as absent. They give her hope that one day, even the oldest, most yellowed prayers will be pulled out and happily discarded. Until then, you keep depositing them back into the box. You weep and you pray and you try to remember that someone\u2019s listening\u2014someone\u2019s counting all your tears in a bottle.</p>"

Metaphorically speaking, each of us have or will at some point encounter our own exiles, the destruction of our own Jerusalems. Whether it\u2019s the loss of a loved one, the loss of a job, or the loss of a marriage, we are bound to be afflicted in this brutally fallen world.</p><p>The above passage calls to mind a single word for me: <i>surrender</i>. On the surface of things, surrender is primarily an act of giving up. The result: a vacancy. But if you think about it, when we truly surrender\u2014when we surrender our sense of control, our sense of wellbeing, our expectations, the hope we have in our abilities and our own strength\u2014we usually do so in unspoken anticipation that something else, something greater will take its place.</p><p>Even in war, the losing side waves a white flag in exchange for <i>life</i>. Similarly, as Christians, what follows our surrender has nothing at all to do with lack. Rather, when we surrender our grief, our losses, our failures, our control, our addictions, we are animated with a new strength, a new hope, a new life that is far beyond the hollow shell of our actual selves. In a sense, this is exactly what the author of Lamentations is saying here.</p><p>When our love has limitations, \u201cthe steadfast love of the LORD never ceases.\u201d<br>When we (and everyone around us) have fallen short, \u201chis mercies never come to an end.\u201d<br>When we (and everyone around us) are unfaithful, \u201cgreat is His faithfulness.\u201d<br>When we are empty, thirsty, longing, \u201cThe LORD is our portion.\u201d</p><p>Dear one, there is an improbable abundance in surrender, even\u2014<i>especially</i>\u2014at your direst point of need. What small or large detail of your life is God calling you to surrender to him today? May your hands be open to let go, and to receive instead his grace.</p>"

Thick-headed Israel is a \u201cstubborn heifer\u201d (Hos 4:16). Unfaithful leaders are \u201call silent dogs that cannot bark\u201d (Is 56:10).

Anyone who has spent time with children knows that being bigger, louder, and more in-charge may appear to work for a moment but will actually get you nowhere fast.</p><p><i>My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways.</i> In this profound declaration, God reminds us that our natural approach to life, and specifically to others, is not how God deals with us.</p><p>Eighteen years ago, I worked as a behavior therapist in Pittsburgh with children and adults with mental illnesses.

In modern medical parlance, this great man had good money to pay the top specialists, yet was now reduced, for all intents and purposes, to standing in line at the free clinic. If he was going to be dipped in any river, it should be a mighty one like those in his country, not a muddy stream like the Jordan. Yet such is his desperation that he swallows his pride and obeys.</p><p>In his search for healing, Naaman suffers an assault on his ego as well as his default assumptions about pain and gain. He had to be unburdened of his expectations about what a cure looks like\u2014and how much it might cost. He had to learn that God is a God of grace, and that healing can\u2019t be earned, only received.</p><p>Likewise with all of us. Hard as it may be, we prefer the grueling path because it flatters our efforts. It allows us to take credit for what only God can do. Where is your ego under assault today?

No matter how old we get, the thought runs through our mind, even as we quickly push it away.</p><p>But with darkness, it\u2019s not about what is actually there, but what is not there. Darkness is not dark\u2014it is not a thing in and of itself\u2014but the absence of a thing, the absence of light. And that absence is spooky. It feels off.

God closes the gaps we create and assaults our defenses. This is terrifying. We build those defenses early in life and trust them to protect us. But God loves us enough to blast His way through our life hacks, emotional tricks, and defense mechanisms to get to us.</p>"

Fear of doing or saying the wrong thing is a common malady, especially in our current age of social media call-out culture. And this fear is understandable, because it is an absolute given that we will do or say something wrong at some point. This is the reality of living in a world full of people infected by sin: we are very capable of hurting one another.</p><p>When our sin becomes apparent, judgment tends to follow\u2014from ourselves, from loved ones, from strangers on the Internet. We may then find ourselves afraid once more of doing or saying the wrong thing, being careful to hide our true selves and appear always completely put together (the opposite of approaching with confidence). This denial of our true and imperfect selves is exhausting. The dishonesty of it all weighs us down.</p><p>But the throne of grace is different. On this throne sits our God, holy and all-knowing, who resolves righteous judgment once and for all by way of a cross. On this throne sits the One who knows exactly who we are: the good, the bad, the ugly. On the throne of grace, God does not shy away from our sin or turn a blind eye. God sees it all as it is and responds with the words, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d</p><p>In this world, the one and only thing we can truly do with confidence is fall to our knees and admit our need for help.

Yet, suspiciously, just before this verse, Jeremiah makes his own declarations: \u201cThe harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.\u201d</p><p>Looking back on this now, we can pity Jeremiah for his too-human, shortsighted outlook. We know that even as Jeremiah spoke, God had plans to redeem Israel through Jesus. But the Bible still holds space for Jeremiah\u2019s mourning, which to me, is saying something. Jeremiah and the Israelites suffered, and their mourning was important. And in his own time, Jeremiah was right. There doesn\u2019t seem to have been much of a balm in any kind of human sense of a near future.</p><p>Perhaps Jeremiah\u2019s question feels at home to me because it reminds me of grief, and the weird math we do to justify our broken world in grieving spaces. After my dad died, I felt a strong pull to have a baby. I felt like that would somehow undo the damage done in the breaking of his body, as if -1 + 1 = 0. But this kind of human math is small dice. To me, Jeremiah models here that we don\u2019t have to try to know God\u2019s wholeness all the time. The way in which brokenness will be made whole is still unknown to us. In spaces of grief, especially, we can ask unaskable questions; once we receive no practical, actionable answer, we can pray for God to open our hearts again\u2014or at least think about praying for God to help us think about maybe opening our hearts.

What this means, perhaps unexpectedly, is that God\u2019s love is always near to us, and He is not so hard to love as we might think. It means that when you love the person in front of you today, when you delight in them and seek their good, you are in that very moment loving the God who has known them from eternity, who has declared them precious beyond all human understanding (Mt 25:40). <i>Les Mis</i> was right: \u201cTo love another person is to see the face of God.\u201d This is no sentimental piety.

TED Talks and social science bestsellers promote the need to stand honestly before our friends, families, coworkers, and teammates\u2014to <i>own</i> who we are with courage. To do so, the experts say, is to be brave, and will foster the belonging we so desperately crave.</p><p>It certainly is brave to be vulnerable, if you\u2019re the psalmist, because it\u2019s not far from social suicide. \u201cVulnerability\u201d is not <i>risking</i> injury\u2014it is <i>assuring</i> it. Nobody but God is worthy of your trust. To live in the world of relationships is to be shaken, to be toppled, to be battered by those around you. All of you, the psalmist says, speak pleasantly face to face, but secretly \u201ctake pleasure in falsehood.\u201d <i>Schadenfreude</i> runs rampant.</p><p>Where, then, are we left? We live our lives inevitably surrounded by (and dependent upon) gamers, schemers, liars, and climbers\u2014people just like us.</p><p>This psalm is all about low expectations. It basically says that nobody, nowhere, at no time, can provide the absolute sense of trustworthiness and belonging you seek. \u201cThose of low estate\u2026those of high estate\u2026they are together lighter than a breath\u201d (v. 9). While the parades of strength continue unabated from the cradle to the grave, they are as expendable as the air you\u2019re breathing now, a puff of smoke. Nothing but God is worthy of your trust.</p><p>Don\u2019t be vulnerable, then, in order to be strong. That\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. Be vulnerable because your weakness lies in strong and trustworthy hands. \u201cOn God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock, my refuge is in God\u201d (v. 7).</p>"

You can marshal your best communication skills, make your most persuasive arguments, use expressive hand motions, raise the volume to eleven, and still they will not hear you. We all have a confounding predisposition to remain deaf to the truth about ourselves, and about God.</p><p>I remember when my youngest daughter first realized that I had a glass eye. I explained to her how, years ago, I had lost my eye in a car wreck. This information blew her seven-year-old mind. She had no category in which to place this troubling new reality: \u201cHow can that be? You mean you really can\u2019t see anything at all with that eye?\u201d \u201cNo, honey.

More effort will not make us \u201csee\u201d or \u201chear\u201d God. In relation to God, we remain blind and deaf, no matter how hard we try.</p><p>In the New Testament, the worst cases of deafness were with people who could not hear the Word of God Himself, the Son of God, speaking words of truth <i>directly to them</i>. If Jesus himself could not get through, who could? Our problem in relation to God is generally much worse than we think. We can\u2019t hear God by trying harder. Our incapacity is so profound that we can\u2019t perceive God even by ramping our efforts \u201cup to eleven\u201d (<i>Spinal Tap</i>, 1984). Something else must happen.

It must be handled in a manner befitting its solemn, invisible glory.</p><p>David\u2019s handling of the ark is not solemn. He has not purified himself and is no priest, but he dons a priest\u2019s garment and prances about before God and everyone, his wife Michal included, leaving nothing to the imagination. David\u2019s freedom, his utter, reckless abandon, is shameful to her. It is not glorious, like the majesty of a king one should barely catch sight of; David is lewd and far too visible.</p><p>It is a curiosity of Christian art that every gory bit of the crucifixion can be shown, except for the Lord\u2019s naked flesh. We wear the death of the Son around our necks, but the shame of his splayed body is too much for us. Like Michal, we feel that keeping peace with the Almighty requires that some things be kept hidden, out of sight. They cannot be seen, cannot be said, perhaps cannot even be thought. Both God and our body of sin must be veiled, as with a priest\u2019s linen apron, or Jesus\u2019 imaginary loincloth. Only then are we safe.</p><p>When David dances before the Lord, the veil of glory is removed, and David is not ashamed. Like a child sprinting around the house after his bath, he is free in his Father\u2019s presence. To Michal and all who seek God in glory, this is contemptible; but to the servants of servants, to the lowest of the low, to those who hide themselves in shame, it is hope and faith.

Without his family name, Romeo would be the same person, right?</p><p>In the book of Hosea, God disagrees with Juliet. He intervenes in the prophet Hosea\u2019s marriage, and declares the names of his three children. The first is named Jezreel, after a city where Israel will experience a great defeat. It\u2019s like a Frenchman naming his child Waterloo, or a Virginian naming her child Gettysburg. The second child is named Lo-ruhamah, meaning \u201cno mercy.\u201d The third child is named Lo-ammi, meaning \u201cnot my people.\u201d</p><p>In these names, God announces his frustration with Israel. Israel made a longstanding commitment to their God, one that had been in place for nearly a thousand years, and Israel was not faithful to their end of the deal. They have begun to import and worship idols, and God likens it to infidelity. So God uses Hosea\u2019s marriage as a reflection of that broken promise, and the product of Hosea\u2019s infidelity is defeat, rejection, and no mercy. And yet, the passage also ends with a promise: The names will be changed. Jezreel will become a place of future victory, God will forgive broken promises, and the people will once again be welcomed as \u201cChildren of the living God.\u201d These names will one day change and mean their opposite.</p><p>God knows your name, and he knows the unfaithfulness that comes along with it. He knows your defeats, and he knows your family history. He knows your bad reputation, and he knows where your name is mud. It\u2019s only through God\u2019s love, more potent than the romance of Shakespeare\u2019s famous lovers, that our names lose their baggage.

    "text": "<p>A couple of things stand out to me about this passage. The first is that it is soaked in tears: Joseph\u2019s, primarily, which both precede and follow verse 8, and his family\u2019s. In his younger years, Joseph so angered his brothers that they left him for dead after he recounted to them his dreams\u2014dreams in which he became more powerful than them. Turns out those dreams came true, as he has since ascended to a senior leadership role in Egypt. Years of famine have impelled the brothers to seek grain from the man who controls its distribution: their long-lost brother, who is now brought to tears by their mere presence. Verse 1 says that \u201cJoseph could no longer control himself\u2026and he cried out.\u201d Cried out so loudly, in fact, that the whole house of Pharaoh could hear him. <i>Awkward!</i> But so overwhelmed by love is Joseph for the family who betrayed him that he cannot\u2014nor does he care to\u2014conceal his emotions.</p><p>This is what grace does to a heart: changes it, leaving it raw, and open, and unconcerned with appearing put-together or composed or anything but <i>real</i>. Joseph had been saved by the grace of a God who found him and led him safely to Egypt. In my own life, tears have often been an indicator of the Spirit at work, moving deeply within my heart beyond what words could express.</p><p>The other thing that stands out in this passage is the rightful recognition of who\u2019s in charge. Joseph knows, even in his position of power, that he is not the \u201cmaster of his fate\u201d or \u201ccaptain of his soul.\u201d Those roles are above his pay grade, for it is and always has been God who engineered circumstances to bring him to this exact moment. With God ultimately in command, as Julian of Norwich says, \u201cHow can anything be amiss?\u201d</p><p>These tears, and this recognition of who is really in control, come from a kinglike figure here in the form of Joseph but point to another King, who not only wept but bled, who not only revealed his emotions but allowed himself to be stripped of all dignity. \u201cNot my will, but yours,\u201d Jesus said in the garden, headed to his own foreshadowed destiny, so that we could know once and for all: When it\u2019s God telling the story, we will always end up right where we should be.</p>"

But in reality, besides the fact that true independence is unattainable, it also does not satisfy like giving and receiving from others.</p><p>When my husband became a pastor, our extended family came to town to celebrate his ordination. We were proud of him for his hard work in seminary and for his accomplishments. One day during this visit, my mother-in-law asked me to step into the other room, and there before me, all shiny and new, was a beautiful table that I had been wanting. She had purchased it for <i>me</i> as a gift for <i>his</i> ordination! I shed the kind of tears that only a truly unexpected and undeserved gift can bring.</p><p>Christ did not give himself what he deserved, and he deserved better than what we take for ourselves. Paul says that Christ, \u201cthough he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited\u201d (v.6). The one who was completely entitled to take all of the power and riches for himself did not. Instead, he became a servant washing his disciples\u2019 feet, spending time with sinners, and dying like a criminal. He relied on God to lift him up. Paul continues, \u201cTherefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name\u201d (v.9). This same Heavenly Father, who exalted Jesus, also has our needs in mind.</p><p>The command to be humble and put others above ourselves does not equate to \u201cdo this and then you will receive that,\u201d because in Christ everything has already been given. It is this unconditional gift that will allow us to become more concerned with others than ourselves. As a wise pastor (okay, my husband) once said, \u201cReceiving undeserved love is the fuel for loving others.\u201d</p>"

I\u2019ll never forget the underwater bonus level.</p><p>On a related note, do you know about the secret 23rd Psalm in the Bible? It\u2019s not one of the famed 150 contained in the actual book of Psalms. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s another Psalm of David at the end of 2 Samuel, in chapters 22 and 23. I think of it as basically a bonus level. The secret bonus Psalm covers much of the familiar material found in the most recognizable Psalm with verses like: \u201cIn my distress I called upon the LORD\u2026\u201d (22:7).</p><p>The opening verse reiterates that great biblical sentiment: \u201cThe LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.\u201d An especially interesting detail lies in the moment in which it occurs. Even after the defeat of Goliath, the Israelites are persecuted by the Philistines for years. 2 Samuel records four more battles with them, long after David\u2019s famous initial victory.</p><p>As with most problems, the situation with the Philistines proves to be a recurring one. You finally recover from an ailment only to have it reemerge, or have a new health issue develop in its place. I remember a friend, who, after recovering from a knee replacement, was diagnosed with melanoma. Fortunately it was treatable, but then came a terrible fall that required months of corrective surgery. Similarly, the Philistines are a relentless threat.</p><p>And when they come against David after that legendary initial victory, to everyone\u2019s surprise, this time David is exhausted (21:15). The next three battles are won, not by David himself, but by his fellow soldiers. The victory belongs to him, in a sense, but he did not win these subsequent battles alone. So it is, in fact, with every conquest: \u201cThe LORD is\u2026my deliverer.\u201d God deserves the credit for every success, and not we ourselves.</p><p>Are you currently facing the reemergence of some difficulty?

Reading it always leaves me disappointed, because I sense that it\u2019s supposed to be more impressive than it really seems to be. Imagine staring straight into the sun. This, we are told, is the glory of God. Honestly, I would hope the Lord is <i>more</i> than a lightshow.</p><p>Which is why I wanted to pay this scene special attention.

There is nothing quite like the feeling of thaw. If in his glory Jesus shines \u201clike the sun,\u201d  then this is what being with Him might feel like: <i>relief</i>.</p><p>But the sun is also blinding. When you take a photo into it, the image becomes blank and white, irreversibly so. There is no editing software that can recover what has been washed out by the light. In his transfiguration, Jesus is revealed to be a photographer\u2019s worst nightmare, a dizzying flash, subsuming all darkness. And though the transfiguration itself lasts only a little while, the light has come to stay.</p><p>Essentially, an overexposed photo is just a white rectangle\u2014like a clean slate, or a blank canvas, which is frightening for the very same reason it is exciting: It is a place of endless possibility. So maybe Aquinas was onto something, I don\u2019t know. But when dreaming of the glory of God, it\u2019s best to dream big. And let your imagination run wild.</p>"

He is, quite literally, the Word(s) brought to life.</p><p>In the Bible\u2019s best mic-drop moment, Jesus informs this crowd\u2014his hometown crowd, no less\u2014that he is the long-awaited Messiah. Such a reveal would have been (and clearly was, if you read on) jarring for the audience, who expected a stately king and instead got \u201cJoseph\u2019s son\u201d (hardly the worst thing they\u2019d called him\u2014see Mark 6:3 for an ancient Near East burn).</p><p>Jesus is undeterred by their doubts. Following the custom of the day, he stands to read the scrolls, but sits to teach. And his teaching is this: I AM.</p><p>I am the fulfillment of scripture. I am the Anointed One. I am the one bringing good news to the poor, proclaiming release for the captives and recovery of sight for the blind. I am the one letting the oppressed go free. I am the one proclaiming the year of the Lord\u2019s favor (a time on the Jewish calendar during which all debts were forgiven). This is good news indeed for those who count themselves as poor, captive, blind, oppressed, or in need of favor. Which we all are, of course.</p><p>One thing he doesn\u2019t mention from Isaiah\u2019s prophecy? The \u201cday of vengeance of our God.\u201d There was no need to announce the coming of God\u2019s vengeance to the people, because it was not coming to them. It was coming, instead, to <i>him</i>, to the Messiah, whose ministry\u2014indeed, whose life\u2014was one long walk toward Calvary, where he was the recipient of divine vengeance.</p><p>Fulfillment and completion. The answer to every question that matters. Vengeance swallowed up by love. What better news could there be?</p>"

This verse is a direct rebuttal to the claim that faith is the one human contribution to our salvation. Faith does not come from making the right choice, nor does it come as a result of grabbing hold of God\u2019s hand. This is because faith is not something that we are humanly capable of. The only thing that can give us any conviction that God is real and that He is with us is God saying, \u201cI love you.\u201d This Word, the life-giving message of Christ, is the only thing that will stir any kind of conviction. Thus, all you have to do is hear the gospel. And the gospel is the birthplace of faith.</p><p>The ears, Martin Luther said, are \u201cthe only organs of the Christian.\u201d His point was that hearing is the most passive of the senses. While the watchful eye and the grabbing hand both suggest a more aggressive mode of action, the ears simply receive whatever comes their way. Their lack of filter leaves them completely vulnerable to their surroundings and, in our modern age, they often take a beating. Chances are your ears pick up jackhammers and sirens more frequently than trickling waterfalls and whispery breezes. The world is full of noise, what Ambrose Bierce once called \u201ca stench in the ear\u2026the chief product\u2026of civilization,\u201d and we are at its mercy.</p><p>As Christians, we experience a God who is not seen but heard. Through scripture, we <i>hear</i> his Word (or, rather, His two words of Law and Gospel). This is what Martin Luther was getting at: that to be human is to be one to whom God speaks. And now that we\u2019ve finally taken a brief moment to listen, what do we hear Him say? Do not be afraid. God is real and He is with you. Jesus Christ has died so that you may live fully and freely. He has removed your transgressions once and for all. Nothing will ever stop Him from loving you. In a noisy world, this word of comfort, the Word of Christ, is all I want to hear.</p>"

S. Lewis wrote a book of essays called <i>God in the Dock</i>\u2014conjuring the image of God in the defendant\u2019s chair. But Habakkuk beats everyone to the punch. His three short chapters are an accusation against God\u2019s goodness and justice. Responding to the prophecy that God would bring judgment against Jerusalem through the wicked Babylonian empire, Habakkuk basically says this to God: \u201cYou say that you are good, but you\u2019re giving a wicked empire the spoils of Israel.

Dostoyevsky imagines that Jesus returns during the Spanish Inquisition, and the Church captures him and subjects him to inquiry. The charges are many: abandoning his people, not feeding the hungry when he had the power to multiply bread, allowing humanity free will to make choices that lead to great suffering. After the Grand Inquisitor finishes the list, he demands a defense. Jesus, wordlessly, stands and kisses the Inquisitor straight on the lips.</p><p>Habakkuk didn\u2019t have the benefit of seeing Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection, when God the Son stood trial against the accusations of the Pharisees. Sometimes we don\u2019t see God\u2019s full plan in action, but we read in Habakkuk that he can handle our frustrations and accusations while his plan unfolds. It is good news that you can come to God with your frustrations and accusations, and God doesn\u2019t turn away.

Daniel\u2019s world was just as much of a mess as ours, and we can join him in this desperate, urgent plea.</p><p>In this chapter, after consulting the prophecies of Jeremiah, Daniel perceives that the exile of the Israelites is about to end, so he turns in hope to prayer. Daniel boldly pleads with God to hear, forgive, pay attention, and act. He emphasizes that God\u2019s people bear his name, reminding God of the vested interest he has in the lives of his people. But he also confesses that they have done nothing to deserve rescue and appeals to God\u2019s mercy. </p><p>All of this could be said today as we look at the world around us and long for God\u2019s restoration. Like Daniel, we look to the end of our exile, to no longer being sojourners on this earth, and to being brought back into God\u2019s presence. We \u201cgroan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies\u201d (Rm 8:23).</p><p>Unlike Daniel, though, we are on this side of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection, holding onto His victory over sin and death and the hope that gives us beyond our circumstances. We have the promise of Christ\u2019s return to deal one final blow to the Enemy and restore everything to how it should have been all along. <i>Come, Lord Jesus!</i></p>"

Paul knew that under Roman law, Onesimus\u2019 actions could be punished by death. So Paul wrote a letter to his friend Philemon, and in verses 4-7 he <i>imputes</i> righteousness to Philemon.

Peter has followed Christ for years and then completely abandons him. Not just once, not even just twice, but three times a denier. Can you imagine living with that guilt? How in the world\u2014why in the world\u2014would Christ build his church on such a feckless rube?</p><p>Christ did not come to save the righteous, and he does not mean to fill his church with them either. Christ looks at each sinner, sees us to our core, and redeems his own completely. After his resurrection, Christ pursues Peter. He asks him if he loves him. Peter says yes. And then he asks him again. And then a third time. Not just once, not even just twice, but three times a lover of Christ. How painful for Peter. But how good of our God. He gave Peter an opportunity to redeem each denial. Christ could have left it unsaid. He could have wiped the slate without a word. But, though painful, there is such beauty in this complete and public renovation of Peter\u2019s soul.</p><p>Our resurrected Lord wasn\u2019t seeking affirmation from his disciple. He was going after Peter and providing this painful, beautiful interaction for Peter\u2019s sake\u2014and for ours, so that we may feel less alone.

A few years later an outfit known as Videeo had a disco hit. Soon MTV was playing clips from a hair metal group named Ratt. I asked a friend what was behind novel spellings. He quipped, \u201cWell, you always got to add a little something.\u201d</p><p>The same sentiment applies to the Corinthians. Paul is upset that they\u2019re adding something to the gospel. It was Jesus plus \u201cI got baptized by this person.\u201d Today we add other pedigrees: the right family, the right politics, the right affiliations. We\u2019re always looking for something more to add so that we might <i>be</i> something more.</p><p>Sadly, the stratagem tends to backfire, in life just as much as religion. Even if it\u2019s something good, like who baptized you, the impulse to add something more creates something less\u2014less unity, less cohesion, less love.</p><p>Furthermore, when we make the spiritual life into a matter of <i>more more more</i>, we turn God into something he\u2019s not. Martin Luther famously remarked, \u201cMen fast, pray, watch, suffer. They intend to appease the wrath of God and to deserve God\u2019s grace by their exertions. But there is no glory in it for God, because by their exertions these workers pronounce God an unmerciful slave driver, an unfaithful and angry Judge. They despise God, make a liar out of Him\u2026\u201d</p><p>Our insistence on the tyranny of <i>more</i> constitutes a refusal to believe that God\u2019s approval of us in Christ is full and final. So where are you clamoring after more? Where is more being demanded of you? The gospel is not about adding anything, but being added to something. It does not have to do with lining up your affiliations but about the God who is undividedly loyal to you despite your disloyalty to him. Who, instead of saying <i>More</i>, says <i>Mine</i>.</p></p><p>Or Miiine.</p>"

When a husband provides his wife with the ninth installment of his armchair lectures on home economics, and he watches (yet again) the lights go out in her eyes.</p><p>The pursuer-withdrawer dynamic happens because, for good reason, the person being pursued expects <i>judgment</i> rather than connection. The withdrawer may genuinely want the exact same thing as the pursuer\u2014to connect with their parent or partner, to love their job\u2014but their suspicion is that the pursuer is not bringing good news, but bad news: more advice, more grievances, more <i>to do</i>. Sadly, when we are pursued by these tactics, we hide.</p><p>You could say that the Bible itself is a <i>collection</i> of these stories, where God\u2019s pursuit of his people leads to withdrawal, leading to more pursuit, and more withdrawal. We withdrew in Eden, we withdrew in Gethsemane, and I suspect you will withdraw in some way today.</p><p>Yes, the pursuer-withdrawer dynamic is alive and well with God. The more the withdrawer withdraws, the more the pursuer pursues. But there is one important distinction. While the rest of the world\u2019s lovers may pursue with any number of selfish needs and vindictive motives, this Pursuer simply seeks <i>you</i>.

The hill was too steep for her parents to climb to ask her to cease these dangerous wanderings, so they stood watching down below. And they were still watching when she flipped over backwards. She lay on the hill, strapped into her chair, which was made of heavy metal. Battery acid had leaked out of it and would soon burn right through her skin.</p><p>My friend tells the story as a funny anecdote of the \u201cfastest she ever saw her dad run.\u201d He sprinted up that hill to unstrap his daughter, carry her down in his arms to a water fountain.

Most of these psalms are attributed to David, a shepherd before he became a king before he became a hunted man. He lived in extremes: one minute bedding his neighbor, the next ordering the execution of her husband; a few months later expecting a child, only to be grieving that child not long after.</p><p>I can relate.</p><p>Not to the specific events\u2014luckily\u2014but to the particular way David\u2019s life and its failings oriented him to God. Who among us hasn\u2019t desired something we don\u2019t have, or wished harm upon our perceived enemy, or experienced grief, or felt targeted? And what David did was bring all of this to God. The psalms are full of lament, of desperation, of highs and lows. They scatter across the emotional spectrum and reveal a heart that cannot escape its Maker.</p><p>This psalm, as they go, is pretty sedate: There aren\u2019t any exclamation points or question marks, no shouts or pleading. It must have been written during a calm moment in David\u2019s life; for what it\u2019s worth, he admits in verse 25 that he\u2019s old. While I personally find comfort in David\u2019s more erratic moments (and the fact that they were included as canon), I also take solace in his certitude here.</p><p>When I was younger, the phrase \u201cdesires of your heart\u201d meant, for me, things like a prom date or a new car. Later, it was a husband and kids. Now, it\u2019s a moment to myself in the bathroom. In any case, what I know now is that my desires, like David himself, can be erratic. And not always oriented to what God wills for me. Maybe you can relate?</p><p>But, also like David, we can bring all of this to God: our desires, and our lament at not receiving them. The broken parts of ourselves, the disappointments, the extremes. Laid bare, we find that we cannot escape our Maker, and the space between what we want and what he wants for us narrows.</p><p>Against all odds, <i>God</i> becomes our desire.

It\u2019s the feeling you get when the rival sports team has an unfortunate loss, or when your frenemy PTA parent has to move away for a spouse\u2019s job. Maybe you\u2019ve taken pleasure in a politician losing an election or a business competitor losing a contract. <i>Schadenfreude</i> may not be a word in every language, but the feeling is universal.</p><p>The book of Obadiah is the shortest in the Old Testament, and it is a story of <i>schadenfreude</i>. When Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian Empire, Israel\u2019s neighbor to the south, Edom, was overjoyed. Edom\u2019s rivalry with Israel went all the way back to the book of Genesis, and the two nations were frequently in conflict. Obadiah tells us that the Edomites cheered on the Babylonians, helped them sack Jerusalem, and killed fleeing refugees. God\u2019s word through Obadiah to Edom is harsh\u2014<i>everything that happened to Jerusalem will happen to you, too</i>. The God of the universe has witnessed Edom\u2019s <i>schadenfreude</i>. It\u2019s of no surprise then that the Babylonians march south and conquer Edom once they\u2019re done with Jerusalem.</p><p>One imagines a God of <i>schadenfreude</i> would be quite sadistic, taking pleasure in human misery from his heavenly throne with a bucket of popcorn in his lap and a cold beer on his side table. Thankfully, the heavens are different. God says that he takes no delight in the death of sinners (Ezek 18:23), and we look no further than the gospel for the fullest evidence of that claim. In Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection, God intervenes in the world of time and space to cure human misery, not take pleasure in it.</p><p>There is no <i>schadenfreude</i> in the heavenly realms. God knows your suffering and is resolving it right now as we live and breathe.<br><br><i>God, we ask that you hasten your return and set all things right; and today, disabuse us of the pleasure we find in the sufferings of enemies.</i></p>"

The woman had been through five husbands and lives with a prospective sixth. She promptly deflects to a debate on Judeo-Samaritan Issues.

It is happening in our families as babies are brought home from the hospital, or as a prodigal child is welcomed home in forgiveness and love. It is happening in our minds and spirits when we have a breakthrough in therapy. Good work is happening all around, and it is an honor that we get to be a part of it in so many ways.</p><p>However, we have not yet seen the <i>completion</i> of the good work in the world. We end each day well aware of the ways that our world is still very much incomplete: We could always use more therapy; our families are still holding onto heartache and resentment; and our cities and countries are wracked with cycles of poverty and inequality. In this verse from Philippians, we read that God will bring the good work to completion by the day of Jesus Christ. It is not yet the day of completion, and that truth hurts daily.</p><p>Thankfully, the fate of the good work among us is eternally and fully in the hands of God. If we were the ones to either start the good work or bring it to completion, our egos would mess up the entire operation. Luckily for us, God begins the good work, and God completes it.</p><p>So today, as you consider these words of St. Paul to the Philippians, be comforted that the whole world does not, in fact, rest on your shoulders. We are graciously given the invitation to be a part of the good work that God is doing, but we do not start the work nor do we complete it. That power and honor rests solely on the shoulders of our suffering Savior, the One who met our broken world face-to-face with the ultimate Good Work: a sacrifice that concludes our story of pain with mercy and, finally, redemption on the day of Jesus Christ.</p>"

No matter where you work or what you do all day, being alive can often feel like treading water. With all of its compartments\u2014work life, family life, social life, spiritual life\u2014it often feels like life itself is impossible to keep balanced.</p><p>This passage reveals how Jesus approaches our \u201ctasks of daily survival.\u201d A man expresses a desire to follow Jesus but asks to bury his father first. Burial at this time in Judaism often involved a year-long period, starting from the time the body was first buried until the bones of the deceased were placed in an ossuary box. Jesus\u2019 response is hardly a shining example of pastoral care to a man who\u2019s clearly grieving the loss of his father, but he sees that this man is using his father\u2019s death as an excuse to put off following Jesus just a little bit longer. As the old Yiddish proverb goes: \u201cWe always keep God waiting while we admit more importunate suitors.\u201d When Jesus says, \u201cLet the dead bury their own dead,\u201d he is talking about spiritual deadness.

Despite lowly origins, he grew up in the royal court of Egypt to become what one can only infer was a cocky, hot-blooded young man\u2014the sort who neither doubts his own righteousness nor his ability to fix things. But then he murders an Egyptian and is forced to flee for his life. Through the next forty years in rural anonymity, he passes from excessive confidence to profound self-doubt. By the time God visits him in a burning bush, Moses is hardly inclined to see himself as the heroic type.</p><p>And yet God nevertheless charges him with the epic task of confronting Pharaoh and bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses naturally wonders, \u201cWho am I?\u201d and peppers God with a litany of quite sensible misgivings. Despite God\u2019s reassurances, Moses still isn\u2019t having it. Then, as if the burning bush thing wasn\u2019t enough, God proceeds to turn Moses\u2019 staff into a snake, then back into a staff, and then covers Moses\u2019 hand with leprosy before healing it again. After all this, as we see in the passage above, Moses <i>still</i> pleads inadequacy and begs God to \u201csend someone else.\u201d</p><p>Who can\u2019t relate? Who doesn\u2019t after all feel inadequate and fearful when confronted by the vast problems of this world or by our own weaknesses and failings, not to mention by the awesome mystery of God? But in this Exodus story, God reminds Moses that we are never the real heroes anyway. And just as God took a murderous \u201cbasket case\u201d like Moses and made him the deliverer of his people and conduit for the Torah, God takes even us and breathes life and purpose and the strength of love into our dreary lives.

Just counting one\u2019s blessings <i>at the expense of</i> expressing one\u2019s pain never works in the long run. So-called comparative suffering is no real help. You need more.</p><p>There is a counterpunch to this, though. It can be helpful, when lost in one\u2019s own pity party, to be reminded that no one person has the corner on pain. The adage \u201cmisery loves company\u201d can be interpreted in two ways. Yes, it\u2019s good to know that we are not the only ones who suffer. But it is also helpful to be comforted by another\u2019s company. Perhaps this is why the Apostle Paul says, \u201cBear one another\u2019s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, Christ became miserable for our sake, suffering for our sins. He has carried the final burden.</p><p><i>Lord Christ, you went to the cross to bear my burden. I ask you, even now, to take that burden anew and give me your peace that passes understanding. Amen.</i></p>"

He graciously walks alongside us through the minutes and years of suffering, improbably crafting that suffering into something beautiful, something new, something altogether redeemed. In the arms of Jesus, we are ultimately carried home, welcomed back like beloved children. There will be no more hurt, there will be nothing left to grieve.

Whatever the reasons for it may be, our suffering is not outside of God\u2019s care for us. This can be painful\u2014why would a loving Father allow such suffering? But not one heartache of ours is wasted. God is making us more like Christ. All is in accordance with his will.</p><p>Secondly, we learn that we have one job, and that is the care of our souls. Peter is not speaking of our temporal bodies but our eternal souls. My own body is much afflicted: I have autoimmune spinal arthritis involving much physical suffering. Peter isn\u2019t telling me to \u201clet go and let God\u201d and not visit a doctor or attempt treatment. Peter knows that suffering threatens our souls. How do we care for our souls? We \u201centrust\u201d them to our faithful Creator. Because our Creator is faithful, we can trust ourselves to him.</p><p>Finally, we are to continue to do good. Is this a prescription to reduce suffering by obedience? Absolutely not. This is an exhortation that even in the midst of suffering, as we entrust ourselves to God, we have the privilege of still doing good. We do not have to pause our lives and suffer. God does not will for us to only experience the hard. He also wants us to, in the midst of inevitable suffering, enjoy our privilege of being co-creators and co-redeemers. The order here is important, though\u2014doing good without trusting God will only lead to guilt and shame. But doing good in the light of trust in God is a great privilege.</p><p>Sufferer, know that God loves you and nothing is outside of his will.

Jesus gives him an impossibility. The man walks away \u201cgrieving.\u201d</p><p>However, Jesus does not stop there. A couple verses later, he gives us the good news: <i>what is impossible to us is possible to God</i> (v. 27). We see this when we continue to read through the Gospels and encounter the death and resurrection of Jesus. We might be discouraged by our own inabilities to do good and become righteous, but we do not have to walk away sad and defeated. Our God does not arrive donning expensive shining armor with a to-do list in hand. Instead, we have a suffering servant who arrives in ordinary clothes on a donkey.

Yet in this letter to Timothy he doesn\u2019t say, \u201cChrist came to save sinners\u2014of whom I <i>was</i> the foremost.\u201d No, Paul says that even then, as one of the greatest evangelists in the history of the church, he remained the chief of sinners. He is reminding us of the unevangelized rooms in our hearts that are perpetually in need of redemption.</p><p>I too am the <i>foremost</i> of sinners. Forget the outright offenses, like my proclivity toward \u201caddictive behavior,\u201d delusions of grandeur, relentless dissatisfaction with reality, and the inexplicable willingness to believe I have everything under control (despite abundant evidence to the contrary). It goes deeper than that.</p><p>Even my sincerest repentance is underwritten with a desire for greatness\u2014not for God\u2019s glory, but for my own. When it\u2019s me in the confessional, at the root of much of my repentance is not just a longing for holiness, but an ambition to become greater. I even need to repent of the motives beneath my repentance.</p><p>Dear one, there is good news. What remains in the dark <i>remains in the dark</i>; but the more we recognize the reach of our sin, the more we will see Christ entering that darkness, bringing light and light and light everlasting. Sin causes death, but death is the precursor to every resurrection.</p>"

When we read about the diligence of the ant in Proverbs (6:6), we are immediately convicted of our sloth; the psalmist indicates that even a sparrow has sense enough to rest at God\u2019s altars (84:3). Jesus would say the same in the Gospels, pointing to birds as a picture of perfect trust in God. Furthermore, God makes Nebuchadnezzar live like an ox for seven years to dismantle his pride (Dan 4).</p><p>Jonah, too, was swallowed by a fish as an indictment of humankind. In that submariner slapstick narrative about a reluctant, runaway prophet, we find that sin disrupts and reverses God\u2019s order. God created people to exercise dominion over \u201cthe fish of the sea\u201d (Gen 1:26). Men do not belong inside fish.</p><p>This imagery ultimately highlights the absurdity of human pretenses. The serpent convinces our first parents they can become like God without God, but the attempt can only make us monstrous. Paul aptly summarizes this in Romans 1: \u201cClaiming to be wise, they became fools; and they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles\u201d (vv. 22-23).</p><p>Thankfully, there\u2019s a greater foolishness that saves: God, in Jesus, became a worm surrounded by vicious dogs that pierced His hands and feet, so that, for eternity, we could surround the Lamb who was slain for our redemption.</p>"

Because if the parable suggested why the sheep became lost in the first place, then this would be a parable about correcting your bad habits, or not losing sight of what\u2019s important, or some other tangible thing you can do to keep the faith: <i>Buck up! Try harder! You wandered before and you better make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.</i> But if any explanation is offered for why the sheep strays, it is simply the fact that it is a sheep, and wandering away is what sheep tend to do! Humans, too, are itinerant and in need of a shepherd.</p><p>A lost sheep tends to die without the protection of a shepherd; you never find packs of wild sheep roaming the countryside. When sheep inevitably wander away, God is the good shepherd who pursues and rescues them. The restoration of the one lost sheep does not depend upon the sheep\u2019s ability to turn or repent or even muster up some semblance of contrition. No\u2014what matters is not the measure of our sorrow, but the measure of God\u2019s mercy. It doesn\u2019t depend on our own will to turn to God, but on God\u2019s will to save.

They are finally going to be God\u2019s faithful people, living in God\u2019s gifted land, perfectly fulfilling all of God\u2019s rules. However, we find that the men of Israel have already taken foreign wives and had children with them. This is a clear violation of Mosaic Law according to both Exodus 34 and Deuteronomy 7.</p><p>Sadly, as we read in Ezra 10, they attempt to realign themselves to God through legalism. Can you imagine the horror of these foreign women and their children who are divorced and disowned in the name of being good? Can you imagine the tremendous guilt of the Jewish husbands, who abandon their families in the name of religious purity, rule-following, or, as some say today, \u201cbeing right with God\u201d?</p><p>If we are honest, all of us have hit some painfully low moments while trying to follow the rules. I once counseled a woman who had hardly slept for over thirty years. Every night she tossed and turned at the memory of her newborn daughter, conceived out of wedlock, being taken from her and put up for adoption in order to maintain the family\u2019s appearance of being \u201cright with God.\u201d</p><p>The Law produces within us two types of grief. St. Paul wrote that \u201cgodly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly grief produces death\u201d (2 Cor 7:10). \u201cWorldly grief\u201d was the response of the Jewish men in Ezra; it means trying to create a quick fix. It only leads to your death and the death of others, because our can-do attitude becomes intertwined with human sin. But \u201cgodly grief\u201d is the response of faith. In godly grief, we turn everything over to Jesus and trust that <i>he</i> will redeem the situation.</p><p>Ezra 10 is a tough place to find inspiration. However, it is a great place to be reminded that in the midst of our massive screw-ups, the ones that really affect ourselves and others, we can fix our eyes on Jesus, who has fulfilled the Law on our behalf and given us the freedom to face our shortcomings with faith and strength. We know that whatever happens, behold, he makes all things new.</p>"

From my earliest memory I can recall thinking, \u201cBoy, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to not worry!\u201d Of course, I could never make it happen. Like trying not to think of a pink elephant when someone says \u201cdon\u2019t think of a pink elephant,\u201d trying not to worry by telling yourself not to worry is nearly impossible. It is even worse when someone else tells you not to worry. If you have ever struggled with anxiety or panic attacks, you know what it feels like when a well-meaning person tells you, simply, not to worry.</p><p>So what are we to make of this injunction from Jesus? Unlike that well-meaning person, Jesus is speaking a deeper truth here. He is not simply telling us to get over our worry. He is reminding us of the way the world actually works. Worry and anxiety take us out of the present moment and into a world that does not exist. When we worry, we put our feet on the shaky ground of a future (or past) constructed in our own mind. Jesus reminds us, through the image of birds, that we did not make the world, and we do not sustain it. We did not cause ourselves to take our first breath, and we cannot add a single hour to our lives by worrying.</p><p>This truth is humbling. Instead of holding on tighter and trying to white-knuckle our way out of anxiety (\u201cJesus said not to worry, Jesus said not to worry, Jesus said not to worry\u201d), we can open our hands and hold on loosely. Our heavenly Father feeds the birds of the air. Are we not of more value than they? Jesus speaks directly into our hearts: <i>You are of infinite value, and my grace is enough.</i></p>"

At the bottom were physiological needs: water, food, and warmth. In the middle were safety, security, and meaningful relationships. At the top was \u201cself-actualization\u201d and the freedom to be creative.</p><p>When Haggai arrives on the scene, the people of Israel are a long way from self-actualization. The bedraggled community had returned to their homeland after seventy years of captivity in Babylon. Water, food, warmth, wages: The community was working hard to acquire these basic needs and was not making progress. God intervened through Haggai, telling the people their priorities were all wrong. They were building nice, paneled houses while the temple lay in ruins from its destruction seventy years prior. The people had forgotten to make God a priority.</p><p>God does something bold with Maslow\u2019s hierarchy: He reveals himself as the essential need, the primary necessity required for life. As Jesus will later teach, \u201cBut strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well\u201d (Mt 6:33). Our food, our safety, our clothing, our work\u2026 As important as these are, the foundational level of our spiritual pyramid is God himself. Everything else comes second.</p><p>What do you <i>need</i> right now? Ask God for it. Thank him for the other ways he\u2019s provided already. After acknowledging his providence and asking for help, wait and see how everything plays out. Perhaps you\u2019ll find, like the Israelites of Haggai\u2019s day, that God is true to his word.

There\u2019s the to-do list for tomorrow that goes onto the next page because of aforementioned un-checked items. There\u2019s the replaying of the conversation that could have gone better. There\u2019s the inner critic, who accuses and destroys. Then there\u2019s the realization that you have to get to sleep <i>right now</i>, because if you don\u2019t, then tomorrow is shot too.

It is the moment when we realize that we cannot carry the load of the law, that our rule-keeping hands of control are not serving us, that the to-do list is crushing, and that we are desperately tired. In repentance, we are simply made aware of the myriad ways that we need a savior.</p><p>Thankfully, repentance is Holy-Spirit-induced. I would certainly not give up control if I had my way! Like with sleep, we are brought to the act of surrender. And we are met in this moment, in this giving up of control, with mercy. Through repentance, we find ourselves face-to-face with our compassionate and suffering Savior, the one who lifted that burden from our shoulders and placed it on His own as He carried the heavy cross to the top of that hill.

We have the oppressed, the brokenhearted, the captives, the prisoners, and the mourners all getting shout-outs, and in a prophecy foreshadowing the Beatitudes, we hear what they\u2019ll receive from God\u2019s Anointed One: good news, healing, liberty, release, favor, comfort, garlands, oil of gladness, a mantle of praise.

But for every gift he bestows upon those willing to identify themselves as members of the above lowly groups, he will pay the price personally. As we head toward our own destinies as oaks of righteousness, he heads toward a different tree, the cross. The cost of our glory is his.</p><p>This is not the end of the story, of course, but it is a truth worth sitting with: The good news of the gospel is only good because Jesus chose to pay the price for it.</p><p>When I was twenty-something, circumstances converged to place me at a stadium in New Jersey, hungover and in need of a shower, face-to-face with a prominent evangelical writer and speaker.

Here, in 1 John, the call to confession is not only a clear call to confess my wrong behavior and hurtful actions, but it is also a call to acknowledge again that sin is indeed a condition that I was born with, not simply a set of behaviors that I engage in. When we confess our sins, we concede that <i>sin</i> is a pervasive malady of unrighteousness and that our only hope is a radical treatment that does not just relieve symptoms, but provides a complete cure of the disease.</p><p>This is why we need a God who is both faithful <i>and</i> just.

    "text": "<p>What is hope? Hope is a future-oriented feeling that is predicated on the belief that things will work out the way we want them to. Hope is an engine that keeps us moving forward towards a future that feels like it is worth getting to. Hopelessness, by contrast, is the feeling that nothing will work out. It makes us feel directionless and motionless, as if the internal engine that keeps us going has blown. It shrinks our vision of possibility. When we cannot see the future, we want to abandon the now.</p><p>It is easy to feel hopeful when the future feels within our grasp\u2014when we can arrange our environment and have control over our actions and choices so that we can easily draw the path between now and the future. But how can we be hopeful when our circumstances or our own inadequacies and weaknesses seem to thwart every attempt we make at drawing a path between now and the future?</p><p>In Paul\u2019s simple prayer from Romans, he asks God to fill us with <i>joy</i> and <i>peace</i>. This is a psychologically astute prayer. Research shows that positive emotions are able to broaden our horizons, generating new creative energies and openness towards the world. Paul\u2019s petition is that we would experience these positive feelings while we trust in God, and in doing so, that we would overflow with hope. But Paul also understood that when we are hopeless, we cannot generate feelings of joy and peace ourselves. That is why his prayer is for God to fill us with what we cannot generate for ourselves.</p><p>If your horizon has shrunk, turn to the God of hope, and trust Him to send you His Holy Spirit, who has the power you do not.</p>"

After the death of Jesus a few days earlier, Peter finds himself depressed, especially since he disowned Jesus at his darkest hour. So he goes back to what\u2019s comfortable: fishing! Peter is good at it, and being out on the open water seems to relax him.

Peter rushes to meet Jesus on the seashore, but before he can even get a word out, Jesus says, in verse 12, \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d No rebuke, no stern look, not even a wagging figure. Just an invitation to a meal. Now, we don\u2019t know all of what they chatted about around that campfire that morning, but \u201cit\u2019s a safe bet\u201d that Peter repented and Jesus forgave (cf. vv. 15-19).</p><p>Ah, what good news for sinners. \u201cCome and have breakfast.\u201d Friends, the same good news is for you today.

    "author": "Benjamin Self",
    "text": "<p>In my early twenties I spent a summer working as a cashier at a Dollar General. One day a heavily-bearded fellow in sunglasses looked straight at me as I was ringing him up and said, \u201cGreater love has no man than this: to lay down his life for his friends.\u201d Awkwardly, I mumbled back, \u201cUh\u2026good quote, man.\u201d</p><p>These are powerful words but not easy ones. In the preceding verse, Jesus had issued a version of his great love-commandment, synthesizing all the law and prophets. Here, we get a glimpse of what that love demands. The stories of martyred saints throughout history fill us with inspiration and conviction: We feel that some great power of love is at work in them, and instinctively seek to honor them, even as we hope never to have to emulate them. I think of the young couple who, in August 2019, died shielding their 2-month-old child in the El Paso Walmart shooting. If that\u2019s not a powerful image of Christ-like love, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>There is immense tragic beauty in someone dying for others, a beauty that inspires believers and nonbelievers alike. Think of all the self-sacrificial film heroes: Gandalf and Frodo, Harry Potter, Iron Man, Groot, John Coffey, Aslan, Neo, that racist dude from <i>Gran Torino</i>\u2026 Perhaps nothing is more compelling to the human soul than the image of someone giving up their life out of love for others, and that\u2019s precisely the type of love that Christ establishes as the ideal in this verse. This is no mere affection between friends or lovers\u2014this is <i>agape</i>, the expansion of the self to include the needs and concerns and desires of others as equal to our own. This is a call to love friends and enemies alike perhaps more than we love ourselves, even to the point of death. It\u2019s an insanely high bar.</p><p>Don\u2019t feel up to it? Neither do I. It\u2019s one thing to say, as Peter did, that we will gladly lay down our lives. It\u2019s quite another, as Peter found out, to actually do it.</p><p>But the good news is that Christ provides the initiative. At several points in this long sermon from John, Jesus makes that explicit, saying \u201cI have loved you\u2026 I have called you\u2026 I chose you\u2026 I appointed you\u2026\u201d He speaks of sending an \u201cAdvocate\u201d. I used to believe that love was some coldly rational decision we make, day-in and day-out, but no. Love is not something we control. It involves difficult choices and sacrifices, to be sure, but the strength to love is most of all a gift of the Spirit, who is with us today and for all time.</p>"

Explaining this passage, he writes that the believer who wants God but can\u2019t feel that God\u2019s there is like the lover who is frustrated, devastated even, by her beloved\u2019s absence. Being disappointed and distressed feels like getting bruised, especially because this feeling of abandonment seems endless. Will God ever be there again? Or will I always be wanting? But Gregory turns this feeling on its head: Because God is infinite, beyond everything I can imagine or hold, I can\u2019t stop wanting God. There will always be more of God to want, to long for and love. And as he reminds us, God <i>is love</i>\u2014the very love that I receive in order to love God and other people.</p><p>Does that help, really? In the middle of despair, words often don\u2019t.

They said, \u201cWWJD,\u201d and they were meant to remind the wearer to constantly ask him or herself, \u201cWhat Would Jesus Do?\u201d The thought was that in remembering, we would go and do likewise. They were a great stroke of genius by the devil. The unattainable law was written on our wrists to enact a million tiny deaths throughout the week. We will never do what Jesus does, and with this throwaway line, John brings that into sharp relief.</p><p>I haven\u2019t performed any miracles lately, on the sabbath or otherwise. I cannot even keep up with the laundry. But you better believe that when I do have a moment of victory, I am not retiring into the crowds, disappearing into the multitude. I may try to do my crowing in a demure, Southern-lady manner, but crow I will. Sinless Jesus doesn\u2019t need the lauding of man. What would Jesus do? Disappear into the multitudes. What would we do? Wait for the reporters to call.</p><p>In the Christian\u2019s union with Christ, we gain eternity. We become heirs. We are brothers and sisters of the Savior. We are baptized into his death and his resurrection. In Christ, we have defeated the devil, even his bracelets. But think on this for a moment: God grants us every iota of Jesus\u2019 earthly righteousness, even his dismissing of adulation. In Christ, we can disappear into the crowd\u2014because the work is finished.</p>"

The preceding three and a half chapters are full of some of the most scathing words of judgment in the Bible. During the reign of King Josiah, the Law of Moses had been forgotten, and cultic prostitution and child sacrifice were common substitute religious practices. It was so bad that when a book containing the Law of Moses was found in the temple\u2019s treasury, nobody even knew what it was!</p><p>The words of Zephaniah are dire: Judah and Jerusalem are destined for destruction. But the book concludes with a word of hope: \u201cyou shall fear disaster no more.\u201d Bad things are coming, says Zephaniah, but God hasn\u2019t abandoned his people, and there will be a time when Jerusalem and Judah will thrive again.</p><p>I once heard a son eulogize his father, who was a pastor, with a kind-hearted story. The son recalled when, as a new driver, he had gotten into a traffic accident, and as the police were sorting out the matter, they placed him in the backseat of their squad car. His father soon arrived and, seeing his son in the back of the police car, his heart was broken. Forgetting the damaged car, the insurance matters, and his family\u2019s reputation, the father went to the police with a simple request: \u201cLet me sit with my son.\u201d The officers obliged, and the father slid into the back seat of the squad car with his son to reassure him that everything would be okay. The father joined his son in the seat of the sinner. To nobody\u2019s surprise, this son grew up to be a pastor, too.</p><p>Even amidst some of the Old Testament\u2019s harshest words of judgment, the gospel is proclaimed. The worst of the worst is not a barrier to God\u2019s love, and that includes your worst too. If God loves Israel in all her failures and foibles, he can love you. Let us give thanks to God that his love is not dependent on our best, and is ever available to us in the backseat of our own personal squad car.</p>"

Likewise, if my son comes home from school acting surly, I assume something happened there that upset him, not that he has it out for me. We are, in other words, incredibly generous in our interpretation of small children. Unfortunately, such generosity of spirit often gets lost in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, usurped by scorekeeping and reciprocity. Instead of interpreting our loved ones\u2019 motivations generously, we assume the opposite.</p><p>In today\u2019s passage, Jesus commends a widow\u2019s sacrificial generosity.

These factors are important and enrich our understanding, but it\u2019s worth noting that that\u2019s not how Jesus read. Instead, \u201cbeginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures\u201d (Lk 24:27). Or as he boldly told the Judeans, \u201cIf you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me\u201d (Jn 5:46).

In his life, before his Passion, he ate and drank loads, with \u201ctax collectors and sinners\u201d of all people. But at the Last Supper, he gave it up, because he, like the ancient priest Aaron, was going to make a sacrifice, and that sacrifice was himself.

They take refuge with Rahab, a prostitute, who saves their lives by hiding them on her roof, lying to the authorities, and sneaking them out of the city. In exchange, the spies agree to spare Rahab and those of her house when the Israelites invade.</p><p>For ancient literature, it\u2019s pretty thrilling stuff, and yet as a child I remember being appalled by the story. I mean, she <i>lied</i>, right? Is the Bible saying that\u2019s okay??? It\u2019s funny how rigid the young mind can be about rules. Not to mention the old mind. It\u2019s also strange that I didn\u2019t suffer the same agony over the fact that\u2014in Joshua 6\u2014the Israelites murder almost the entire city. Still, Rahab\u2019s story begs the question: Is lying always wrong? A <i>Christianity Today</i> article summarized the issue: \u201cThe Bible condemns deception\u2026 Even so, when Rahab\u2019s story is told\u2026the Bible\u2014while not justifying her lie\u2014does not condemn it. The same is true of the midwives\u2019 lie (Exod. 1:15-21) and Elisha\u2019s lie (2 Kings 6:19).\u201d Beyond scripture, I think we can all envision scenarios both routine and extreme in which lying might be commendable, and yet none of this lessens the general importance of telling the truth; it only suggests that the ethical water is a tad murky.</p><p>Is lying always wrong? Who cares? Ethical purity was never the point. We don\u2019t worship the law, nor are we saved by it. The Bible contains much ethical teaching but is not an instruction manual. It is rather\u2014as Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel put it\u2014the story of \u201cGod\u2019s search for man.\u201d Twice in 1 Corinthians, that great expert in the law, St. Paul, writes that \u201c\u2018All things are lawful,\u2019 but not all things are beneficial.\u201d Such a notion doesn\u2019t lessen the importance of the law but emphasizes the strange freedom that comes from trusting in a loving power greater than ourselves.</p>"

    "author": "Joshua Retterer",
    "text": "<p>A news story from early 2020 reported on the swarms of locusts ravaging Kenya. One shocking factoid sticks in my head: a single swarm can contain 40 million locusts, which can eat <i>80 tons</i> of food in a single day. That amount of food could feed 35,000 people. To make matters worse, many farmers not only lost the year\u2019s harvest, but the seed for the following year\u2019s harvest as well. What is often forgotten, as one government official pointed out, is that the damage isn\u2019t limited to the loss of food for people and their livestock but has a devastating impact on the <i>entire</i> ecosystem. The locusts consume everything that\u2019s green, effectively rendering the landscape lifeless. Recovery is measured in years, maybe decades.</p><p>In the book of Joel, God\u2019s people were experiencing successive plagues of locusts. Whether real insects or invading armies, the effect was the same\u2014what one swarm missed, the next one ate. They weren\u2019t simply going to tighten their belts and tough it out for the rest of the season; their future was dead. You can\u2019t plant seeds that don\u2019t exist. In plain language, zero plus zero still equals zero.</p><p>Many of us have felt similarly: helpless, with a side of bleak. We may have lost in love, had career setbacks, experienced ill health, or all of the above. The future stretches out before us like a desert, lifeless and dry. We can\u2019t undo what has been done, and it doesn\u2019t feel like there is a \u201cnext.\u201d This was the collective state of God\u2019s people, and it was at that very moment that God promised to do the impossible. He promised to restore the people to the state they were in before the locusts took everything. Only one thing was certain: Something like that was going to take a miracle.</p><p>Impossible situations, ones that don\u2019t add up, are God\u2019s specialty. When sin and death left us at zero\u2014which is the <i>exact</i> percentage we are able to contribute to the endeavor\u2014Christ changed life\u2019s arithmetic forever on the cross. Jesus <i>lived</i> our poverty and pain, our hunger and thirst; that blood on the cross was real. It was there that the restoration of everything was done. Death can never undo it, and poverty can never take it away. In place of nothing, Christ gave us everything: a future forever with Him.</p>"

While we continue to miss the warning signs from the past, while we continue to try new interventions to today\u2019s tough subject, interventions that wind up making our tough times tougher, the truth remains: God has done something, and his plan is unfolding.

Though we are steeped in the myth of the arms race and a fight to the top, that is not where God is found. God calls us out of the race, out of the violence and oppression, to level ground. There, we seek peace rather than victory; we strive to make compromises with fellow children of God. And we remember that Jesus is the ultimate peacemaker, so we no longer need to defend ourselves. For we are weary of that battle.</p>"

The Apostle Paul summarizes the call of every Christian: \u201cSet your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.\u201d</p><p>This seems easy enough on paper, but how often have we resolved to do something (set your mind on things above, eat right, stop resenting your jabroni of a brother-in-law, etc.) and immediately failed? What hope do we have that we can actually set our minds on things above? Alone, we have no hope, but Paul offers a glimmer of light through this seemingly dark pronouncement: that we have already died and been raised.</p><p>The Christian life is not one of gritting our teeth to focus on or do the right things. The Christian life is a letting-go, a dying; a loosening grip to let the grace and mercy of God rest on us and work through us. Our life is hidden with Christ and will be revealed in glory on the Last Day. Until that time we must be reminded every day (or minute or second) that the small \u201cme,\u201d the Old Adam, the false self, has died\u2014and the true self, the me that is known to God, has been raised with Christ.

He\u2019s from the tribe of Benjamin, which means \u201cson of the right hand.\u201d Thus, in delicious irony, God sends Israel a backwards kind of savior: a left-handed deliverer from a right-handed tribe.</p><p>But read on and things get even more ironic. By the end of Judges, the tribe of Benjamin is criminalized. Some in their number are guilty of gang rape, resulting in the victim\u2019s death, leading to civil war and the near-destruction of the entire tribe of Benjamin. So in the big picture of this book, Ehud is just all wrong: wrong hand, wrong tribe, wrong guy for the right job of saving Israel.</p><p>God, however, prefers the wrong people. He makes Sarah, a jaded 90-year-old woman, get pregnant. He sends Jonah, who\u2019s just itching for God to blowtorch Nineveh, to preach mercy to that same city. He transforms Saul, the bloodthirsty persecutor of Christians, into the apostle to the Gentiles. And, as his <i>coup de gr\u00e2ce</i> to all our conventionally religious ways of thinking, he points to the son of a poor family\u2014who was raised in the boondocks, hung out with immoral riffraff, and eventually got himself executed as an enemy of the state\u2014and calls him the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and Irony of Ironies.</p><p>Jesus, like our lefty friend Ehud, is a backwards kind of savior. The wrong guy for the right job of redeeming the world. But the Lord\u2019s ways are not our ways, for he \u201cchose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption\u201d (1 Cor 1:27-30).

I\u2019d wager that no one is entirely free from the temporary respite that any addiction, be it shopping or social media, provides from a loud sense of dislodging. We deeply know that something in the body is not right, and that our body within this world is not right. We then look to fix the missingness with a not-right puzzle piece. (I borrow this idea both from my own experience of addiction but also from David Tremaine\u2019s idea of addiction as an indication of an invitation from God.)</p><p>Later in the psalm, our writer pleads with Jerusalem to let his right hand be forgotten, and to let his tongue cement, should he forget it, implying that unless he continues to profess the story of his true home, he will calcify in desperation.</p><p>In other words, longing for Jerusalem is hope. Longing for Jerusalem reminds us that, once, Jerusalem existed.

They told her stories about school and ate her \u201chidden\u201d chocolate bars. It was incredibly comforting. When we pulled out of her driveway, unsure of what we would face back home, I looked at her and realized she was weeping. I had never seen my grandmother cry.

It is unwavering. There is nothing in our capacity to change the condition of that love. When we fail: <i>I have loved you with an everlasting love.</i> When we succeed: <i>I have loved you with an everlasting love.</i> And of course in our smallest, darkest, most painful moments: <i>I have loved you with an everlasting love.</i></p><p>Jesus\u2019 love for us is so grand, so all-encompassing, so determined to stay fixed on you and me, so <i>everlasting</i>, that he died to prove it. There is nothing we can do, better or worse, that can change this magnificent fact.</p><p>Consider for a minute how this verse speaks to your own montage of unworthiness.

    "text": "<p>This passage is high-octane gospel, turbo-powered good news for sinners and sufferers like you and me, like all of us, because it identifies the heart of the gospel: the grace of God in Jesus Christ. The grace of God is the unconditional love of God for you that has no ulterior motives, no strings attached, no catch\u2014God\u2019s love for you that \u201cnever ends\u201d (1 Cor 13:8). God\u2019s love for you is so great that it \u201csurpasses knowledge\u201d and cannot be measured (Eph 3:18-19). The grace of God means that God not only loves you, but God <i>likes</i> you, too.</p><p>This is the heart of the gospel\u2014\u201cby grace you have been saved\u201d (Eph 2:8). In other words, no grace, no gospel. This grace was expressed historically, definitively, once for all in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This \u201cgrace upon grace\u201d has already been given, is being given, and will always be given in Jesus Christ\u2014not just for some, but for all of us. God\u2019s grace is comprehensive in the best sense.</p><p>Moreover, the entire Bible is brilliantly summarized here: \u201cThe law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\u201d The Old Testament law was and is superseded by New Testament grace. The law of the Old Testament is what Joshua told Israel near the end of his life: \u201c[C]hoose this day whom you will serve\u201d (Josh 24:15). The grace and truth of the New Testament is what Jesus told his disciples at the Last Supper: \u201cYou did not choose me <i>but I chose you</i>\u201d (Jn 15:16).</p><p>This \u201cgrace upon grace\u201d defines your life\u2014\u201cyou are not under law but under grace\u201d (Rom 6:14). And this grace is inexhaustible. Every single time you need God\u2019s grace, which is every single moment of your life, God\u2019s grace is there for you. Grace upon grace, grace upon grace, grace upon grace. It is God\u2019s heartbeat of love for you that has never stopped, and never will.</p>"

The sanctuary is peopled by a mom and dad and three little girls in pretty dresses, there by a widower with his old wooden cane propped against the pew, with teens and newlyweds and the random stranger filling in the gaps. The bells toll, whispered chatter subsides, and the organ begins painting the air with the colors of music.</p><p>And they sing. The little girls with their little voices. The old widower with his half-wheezing baritone. The dad who can\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket, sing-speaking the words anyway. This mix of old and young, men and women, who outside this space might have little if nothing in common, here do together a quintessentially human thing: They testify to the deepest bonds of humanity in the communion of song.</p><p>When the preacher who wrote Hebrews wanted to make it clear that Christ doesn\u2019t slough off his humanity as soon as he\u2019s completed his mission, that he truly and everlastingly shares our flesh and blood, suffers as we too suffer, dies as we too die, and is made like us in all things\u2014to prove all this, the preacher turns to song. \u201cI will tell of your name to my brothers,\u201d he quotes the Messiah as saying, \u201cin the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.\u201d</p><p>In the midst of the congregation, surrounded by his brothers and sisters in this vast choir of humanity, Emmanuel opens his own mouth to sing. He who sang creation into being sings now as a creature, too. He who, in Eden, breathed into Adam the breath of life exhales hymns to his Father as the new and last Adam.</p><p>Our Lord and our God, who is our brother and redeemer, demonstrates the deepest bonds he shares with our humanity in the communion of song. There\u2019s hardly a more striking image than picturing a worldwide choir, open-mouthed, lifting their voices on high\u2014and in the very middle of them stands the God who became our brother, our friend, our fellow-singer and savior.</p>"

It would be hard not to feel like your life has been a waste when the folks you are sent to turn away from disaster insist on running <i>towards</i> it.

Even when I was young, I would try reading a chapter a day, and could keep it up for a little while. Come Leviticus, though, and I\u2019d be done for. Even if I were reading something that intrigued me and spoke directly to me, like Paul\u2019s letters, I couldn\u2019t stay on track. In college, I tried keeping a simple journal. That soon metastasized into a sprawling digital exegesis, in which I attempted to interpret whole epistles with copy-and-pasted academic commentary and hyperlinks to interlinear translations. Which is to say, under the pressure of piety, devotion turned into homework.</p><p>Sometimes I enjoyed approaching scripture this way. I can understand the flow of thought better when I take time to ruminate, to read and reread at a snail\u2019s pace, to reflect on each section in light of the others. But it also produces anxiety. Am I \u201crightly dividing the word of truth,\u201d or am I \u201cconceited, understanding nothing,\u201d as Paul describes various church factions to Timothy? And even after devoting all this time to \u201cthe word of the LORD,\u201d why is my life still glitching?</p><p>There is always more to read. Why not read two chapters instead of one? Why not read twice a day? Why not a commentary, or four? Why read that novel when you could be meditating on the Bible? This endless stream of questions is \u201ca weariness of the flesh.\u201d</p><p>In its weariness, it is this \u201cflesh\u201d that finally makes God knowable. Bookmaking and studying go on forever. But when the Word finally becomes flesh, he lets himself grow weary alongside us. That Word is not a text for us to understand but a Someone who already understands us. And Paul said the Spirit prays for us when we don\u2019t even know what to ask for. Whatever is good for us, God is already going ahead of us to do perfectly. So we can fumble our way into it, acknowledging how weary we are but knowing God\u2019s Word and Spirit are already on our side.</p>"

Paul is quick, in his letters to the Corinthians and elsewhere, to call a sin a sin.</p><p>But in today\u2019s passage, Paul is just as quick to call for forgiveness.

Paul wrote them a now-missing letter (v. 4) which apparently laid out Paul\u2019s disappointment with the Corinthian church, a letter which was painful to write and no doubt painful to read.

For that sinner to live through a kind of never-ending Cold War from his fellow believers could put him at risk of becoming \u201coverwhelmed by excessive sorrow.\u201d The whole purpose of confrontation was not so that this man might live under a cloud of guilt, but rather so that he might confess and freely receive forgiveness.

Any counsel coming from Polonius is suspicious, but the sentiment has persisted over the generations: \u201cThe clothes make the man.\u201d</p><p>In today\u2019s passage, the prophet Zechariah has a vision about clothes. He sees Joshua, the high priest of Israel at the time, standing before God\u2019s angel and being accused by Satan. Why the accusation? The high priest wasn\u2019t wearing the correct clothing for his job. He should have been wearing an opulent vestment of purple and blue and gold and gems, but instead his clothes were filthy rags.

God, through his angels, gives Joshua the very thing he lacks, turning him from law-breaker to law-obeyer.</p><p>To say the clothes make the man is one thing, but in Zechariah\u2019s vision, we see that God makes the clothes. He clothes his saints in white, removing their tattered and torn rags and replacing them with royal, spotless robes. That\u2019s his promise to all his people: The wear-and-tear of life on earth will be washed away, and we will all be given the gift of righteousness.

That, in the cafeteria, I should be unashamed to pull out my Bible (in its sweet carrying case). I don\u2019t mean to dissuade any young people from doing these things, but I have come to realize that this is not what Paul has in mind.</p><p>In her book, <i>The Crucifixion</i>, theologian Fleming Rutledge dedicates many pages to showing how shameful the cross of Christ would have been in the first century. Even more surprising is the claim that the crucifixion of Jesus accomplished something that was almost unimaginable: The shameful cross repaired the breach between God and man. It put right that which was broken. It made the atonement that was required for the world to be whole.</p><p>We live in a secular, cynical age. Secular because we operate as though the transcendent God is not real or at least does not act in human life. Because of this, we operate with a dangerously high anthropology\u2014we think humans can and should fix the world\u2019s problems. This leads to cynicism, because five minutes spent with humans causes one to realize that a world in human hands is doomed. The problems are too big. The hole we are in is too deep.</p><p>Into this world, God speaks the seemingly shameful truth that the world has been saved by a transcendent God. The shameful cross of Christ knocks our anthropology down a few pegs to its rightful place. We cannot save ourselves, but Christ can and did. Beyond the initial shock of the shameful cross, we find salvation and peace. Beyond the humiliation of Christ, we find humility. In that humility, we can begin to live by faith and be unashamed.</p>"

And God, in keeping with his promise, pardoned over 120,000 people (and \u201cmuch cattle\u201d) from their sin, relenting from the foretold disaster. Jonah, however, is irate. He launches a diatribe against grace, reminding God that, although he knows God is gracious and slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and all that, the Ninevites certainly don\u2019t warrant forgiveness. Come on, God.

But balance is not the same thing as love. Frisbees are perfectly balanced; strong marriages are not. Nor are strong relationships with friends, parents, or siblings. We eventually lose in all our relationships when a balanced score becomes the goal.</p><p>Our fundamental imbalance can, by the grace of God, be one of the great joys of relationships. When my wife and I got married, we two became one in a mystic union. To my way of thinking, this means that my Lifetime Grade Point Average (LGPA) took an enormous leap the second we exchanged vows. Prior to our marriage, she enjoyed an elevated academic status. I did not. However, through the miracle of grace, we take her cumulative LGPA and combine it with mine.

By virtue of the grace that she extends me, I find myself to be smarter, better looking, and funnier. I have made her a better dancer; she makes me a more thoughtful listener. I contribute a knowledge of various ales; she contributes a deeper knowledge of politics. I taught her to fish; she taught me long division. We find that we are more together than we were separately.</p><p>Perfect equality, fairness, and balance never made anyone\u2019s loins quiver. A married couple that has successfully attained a perfectly even score is not \u201ca sign of Christ\u2019s love to this sinful and broken world.\u201d Balance does not encourage or inspire.

We are people of obligation, always beholden to someone and eager to invite others to become equally beholden, which we call \u201cfree.\u201d Is this not our commission?</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, it is not. Paul\u2019s great desire is for the gospel to have no cost associated with it; not for the preacher, and not for the hearer. He means to give it away, so that all who hear are truly free. Just how free? Certainly free from guilt and free from sin, because the blood of Jesus has declared it so; free from death, because the word freely preached is the word of Resurrection; free from fear, because Christ reigns and no power can oppose him. Could anyone be more free than that?</p><p>Yes. As Paul notes, the Lord has commanded that laborers should be paid, but Paul acknowledges this command only to refuse it for himself. This means he ignores the command of <i>Jesus</i>, not because he is above Christ, but precisely because he belongs to him. The one who hears the gospel of Jesus is free, because freedom is not a kind of higher debt, but the condition of life without any law at all. It is being Lord over the law, belonging to and living in Christ himself, who cannot be traded, owed, or governed\u2014only given.

Struggling with the Almighty goes all the way back to the Jewish forefather Jacob\u2014which is who Hosea is talking about in the passage above. In utero, Jacob grappled with his twin Esau. As an adult, he swindled Esau\u2019s birthright and a blessing from him, so Jacob had to flee. The night before he is to meet Esau again, he is frantic. His twin is likely still angry, enough to hurt him and his family. He begs God\u2019s help, but God appears silent. Instead, \u201ca man\u201d shows up and wrangles him till dawn, dislocating Jacob\u2019s hip.

But in the play, the characters call a blessing \u201cmore life.\u201d Unlike the pious but ambiguous word \u201cblessing,\u201d you can feel \u201cmore life\u201d immediately.

As a child, this message felt like a given. Of course God will take care of me; God loves me!</p><p>As an adult, this song and scripture (and, let\u2019s be honest, my version of \u201ccare\u201d) always feel more complicated. I can easily be convinced that if God really cares for me then He will give me <i>X</i> thing that I am convinced I need. I can begin to rate God\u2019s care: <i>4/10 stars, Lord. Would not recommend.</i></p><p>His care becomes contingent on my feelings. Which is probably the heart of this passage. We do not actually know what we want. Or, in my case, we want questionable things.</p><p>I would like quiet children. I would like macaroni and cheese to be healthy. Oh, and as long as I am making a wish-list, I would love to be the Queen of the Universe. But God does not always give us what we want or need, even if we ask nicely.</p><p>There is a reason that Jesus describes God as a parent in this passage. Because the best mothers and fathers do not give children what they want; they give them what they need. Mercy, consolation, encouragement, and above all, love. And if we are really honest, it is probably what we have been knocking, and seeking, and asking for all along.</p>"

    "text": "<p>Tip number one for being a good listener: Don\u2019t interrupt the person talking. Sounds simple, but why is it so hard? Perhaps because most interruptions don\u2019t take the form of sudden interjections. They come disguised as questions, or advice, or the sharing of personal experience. \u201cOh, that happened to me once,\u201d we sympathize. The result tends to be a derailing of whatever is being shared. \u201cUh, I forgot what I was saying.\u201d</p><p>William Faulkner once wrote, \u201cSomebody to talk to\u2026not to converse with you nor even agree with you, but just to keep quiet and listen. Which is all that people really want, really need.\u201d Not being listened to, on the other hand, breeds anger and contempt.</p><p>Would people describe you as a good listener? Or, when someone else is talking, are you really just waiting for your own turn to speak?</p><p>The truth is, good listening is as rare as it is healing. There\u2019s always a reason not to listen to another person. Maybe we feel crunched for time. Maybe we think we already know what the person is going to say.</p><p>Yet when someone actually takes the time to listen to us\u2014<i>sans</i> judgment\u2014it\u2019s almost shocking. You can feel the earth shifting under your feet. The sensation of being listened to is akin to that of being loved. Anger dissipates, hearts soften. It is akin to the experience of grace.</p><p>On the flipside, when you actually listen to another person, you find out they\u2019re not as alien as you expected. They have reasons for believing, or acting, or voting the way they do\u2014and <i>vice versa</i>. You might even start to love <i>them</i>.</p><p>How does one become a listener like Isaiah describes? Perhaps today it can begin by looking to the God who listens in infinite compassion to all the terrible listeners of the world. The God who absorbs our many words and the pain they so often cause\u2014and then <i>interrupts</i> our self-centered chatter, not with a command to be quiet, but with a Word of grace made flesh.</p><p>Can you hear it?</p>"

But even the one with cosmic real estate holdings put down roots in a particular spot. The Holy of Holies, the cube-shaped inner sanctum of the temple, was God\u2019s space in Israel. Here was the epicenter of glory. Here was the heart of holiness. Here, too, was restricted access, for a thick curtain hung as a barrier between God\u2019s turf and the rest of the world.</p><p>When Jesus cried out and took his last breath, God grabbed the top of the temple curtain with both hands and yanked downward. That rip was him kicking down the front door of his home, taking the front gate off the hinges, and walking away into the big, broad world with his glory in tow. God went international.</p><p>The death of Jesus released God\u2019s glory and holiness into the world. His ministry had already prepared us for it. In touching lepers, embracing pariahs, and dining with undesirables, Jesus sent a loud and clear signal that business as usual was over. God\u2019s glory now hovered over a table full of tax collectors. Holiness hung as halos over untouchables. The \u201cinner sanctum\u201d became that space where the Friend of Sinners summoned the broken.</p><p>Christ\u2019s death sealed the deal. Just as God\u2019s breath exhaled life upon creation at the start, now the Son\u2019s exhalation upon the cross breathed new life across the cosmos. The Lord has come to save us, to sanctify us, to make us his own.</p>"

Matthew is actually telling a story worthy of any tabloid, with repeated notes of scandal and disobedience. Solomon is born from David by \u201cthe wife of Uriah\u201d\u2014an illegitimate child born to a murderer. The majority of the kings that follow David \u201cdid what was evil in the sight of the LORD\u201d (1 Kings 11:6, etc.). This evil leads to the \u201cdeportation to Babylon,\u201d the cataclysmic destruction of the nation itself by the sword of an invader. Matthew\u2019s genealogy narrates the repeated tragic failures of Israel, the disturbing shadow side of its history. The coming of the Messiah is not the crowning moment of an illustrious story of faith and salvation, but the advent of a savior to a violent and sinful people.</p><p>Jesus came to redeem sinners, to rescue the \u201clost sheep\u201d who have wandered away from God. The disastrous history of Israel was not met with retributive fires of judgment, but with grace. Christ came with merciful judgment over Israel and the world, preaching forgiveness of sin and the rescue of the lost. The history of Israel is his own, and he takes it upon himself in order to expunge its transgressions from the record.</p><p>Our sin is nothing new to God. He has seen it all before, time and time again. We might be people with questionable moral character or checkered pasts, but we are neither better nor worse than Rahab, Ruth, David, Solomon, or Hezekiah. In the economy of the grace of the Messiah, our sin is the only currency we have; our righteousness is of no value. His judgment is both true and gracious.

When you think back to your own childhood and your first memories, it is impossible not to recall moments of fear. Humans, by nature, are fearful.</p><p>When you consider the fears of your childhood, most of them were probably found in the imagination, sparked by the darkness of night. My own imagination would run wild as I tried to sleep, surrounded by porcelain dolls looking down at me. I would pray that God would protect me from an imminent attack by Freddy Kreuger in my waterbed. I would cling to my Bible and recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer until I fell asleep.</p><p>According to psychologist Sally Goddard Blythe, \u201cSleep brings with it separation from the outside world and from others, enclosing us in the inner world of the mind. It has sometimes been described as the little death.\u201d Left on our own in the dark, we convince ourselves that we are detached from the world, others, and ultimately God. Left alone, we can become captive to our fears and doubt God\u2019s goodness.</p><p>But guess what? God knows that from our birth to our final sleep, we are creatures bound by fear. So what does our Father do? He assures us by speaking to us. In the verse given to us today, God says, \u201cDo not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God.\u201d Just as parents assure their children that there is no boogie-man under the bed and, most importantly, that the parents are with them, our God does the same thing with us, his little children, reminding us that we need not be afraid, for he is always with us.</p><p><i>Lord, thank you for your word that reminds us we have nothing to fear, for we belong to you. Your word directly assures us that no matter how dark life may become, we will never be apart from you, our Father and Redeemer. In your mercy, hear our prayer.</i></p>"

What are the pretend arguments you\u2019re rehearsing today?</p><p>By way of contrast, in the Sermon on the Mount, Christ equates anger with murder (vv. 21-22) and then elevates interpersonal reconciliation above worship. Stop whatever you\u2019re doing, he seems to say, and go apologize to anyone you\u2019ve wronged. There is no such thing as a \u201chealthy grudge.\u201d</p><p>The best apologies, by the way, are short and don\u2019t include explanations that can undo them.

Perhaps this is because some kinds of anger feel good. How else to explain the phenomenon of \u201chate-watching/-reading\u201d? As one dictum puts it, the only thing better than being right is being wronged. Apologizing, as well as accepting an apology, involves a loss: of power, of pleasure, of pride.</p><p>What grudges are you currently holding? Who might be accusing you, and what is keeping you from seeking reconciliation? Say these things out loud and listen to how they sound.</p><p>Thankfully, Jesus doesn\u2019t just urge us toward reconciliation. He embodies the kind of atoning love which suffers the loss of all things for its sake. He refuses to go on the defensive or indulge our grievances. Instead, he allows his accusers to hand him over to the judge, paying every last penny of the damages we incur with our stubbornness.</p><p>So while you may be litigating and re-litigating other people\u2019s wrongdoing (and your own), the only argument that truly matters has been settled. You may have built a strong case against God, but He has dropped the charges against you. No \u201cifs,\u201d \u201cands,\u201d or \u201cbuts.\u201d</p>"

How can we be both sacrificed (killed) and alive?</p><p>In ancient Israel, when an animal was sacrificed to God, there was no getting it back after it was burned on the altar. It was a substitute which atoned for the sin of the people, the ones who actually deserved that death. In other words, there was no such thing as a \u201cliving sacrifice.\u201d You were either the sacrifice (the animal) or the living (the people).</p><p>However, Jesus Christ changed all of that. He became the first living sacrifice. He died and is now alive. He invites us to follow him in his death and resurrection. Does that mean we have to wait for our own deaths to be living sacrifices? No, Paul is talking to us in the here and now. He explains how we are simultaneously dead and alive when he says, \u201cDo you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life\u201d (Rm 6:3-4).</p><p>We died in the waters of baptism. Dead to sin, alive in Christ. In baptism (not in taking care of our bodies), God sets us apart and makes us holy and acceptable.

A donkey named Puzzle disguises himself as the Christ figure, the lion named Aslan. Many Narnians are duped, and when the ruse is finally discovered, many Narnians lose interest in the real Aslan, or even begin to hate him.</p><p>Malachi contrasts the corrupt clergy of his day with the ideal priest embodied in the father of the Jewish priesthood, Levi. The only problem with this comparison is that Levi, in Genesis 34, vengefully slaughters the people of Shechem. The crime is so brutal that it turns the people of Shechem away from God. And in 1 Kings 12, Shechem is the site where the dastardly King Rehoboam leads astray ten of the twelves tribes of Israel and establishes what became known as Samaria.</p><p>For Malachi, the ideal priest is the messenger of the Lord; people should seek instruction from him. Therefore, Malachi\u2019s prophecy looks forward to another priest, one whose work would be the foundation of a new covenant of life.</p><p>In John 4, this priest would go through the country of Samaria and in the town of Shechem engage a Samaritan woman at a well.

Their mission began on the pagan-dominated island of Cyprus, a visit that culminated in a showdown in the town of Paphos. According to local Cypriot tradition, it was in Paphos that Paul received perhaps his first lashing, likely at the behest of Elymas. My family lived on that storied island when I was in elementary school and I still vividly remember the heavily-worn marble pillar where locals say Paul was strung up and whipped. It\u2019s the kind of image you don\u2019t forget.</p><p>After departing Paphos, Mark mysteriously bolts and returns prematurely to Jerusalem. Was he sick, homesick, exhausted? Or just scared? The text gives no answer, but given the hardships Paul faced throughout his ministry, it\u2019s easy to see why young Mark might bail. Later, in Acts 15, Paul is unwilling to forgive Mark for having \u201cdeserted them\u201d (v. 38). The dispute over Mark becomes \u201cso sharp\u201d that Paul and Barnabas part company over it, a sad moment of disunion in the early history of the church.</p><p>And yet here in 2 Timothy, in spite of everything, we find Paul in need and sending for Mark, even admitting that Mark has been \u201cuseful in my ministry.\u201d It seems Paul is now ready to forgive and admit he has been wrong about Mark, who the Bible tells us elsewhere, continued to serve with Barnabas and was later like a \u201cson\u201d to Peter (1 Pt 5:13). According to tradition, this is the same Mark that eventually authored the first of the Gospels and is credited as the founder of the Coptic Church in Egypt, where they even believe\u2014despite Mark\u2019s early squeamishness\u2014that he died a martyr, being dragged to death by an angry mob.</p><p>If I\u2019m being honest, I love this verse most for the <i>schadenfreude</i>: It\u2019s nice to see the great Apostle Paul have to eat a little crow by requesting help from someone he\u2019d written off.

But when Jesus comes around, they shame him: \u201cLook, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!\u201d They\u2019ve set up a catch-22. Jesus replies, in typical perplexing fashion, \u201cwisdom is vindicated by all her children\u201d (Lk 7:33-35).</p><p>Jesus means he is Wisdom, a strange figure who appears in Proverbs. She (Wisdom) wants to save people from the dangers of foolishness. But she\u2019s not a self-help guru or a moralist. She\u2019s a cosmic builder: \u201cWhen he\u201d\u2014the LORD\u2014\u201cestablished the heavens, I was there.\u201d She\u2019s God\u2019s delight, and she wants everyone to feel that joy (Prov 8-9).</p><p>One of Wisdom\u2019s main aims is to keep us off the streets and out of Folly\u2019s house, where \u201cbread eaten in secret\u201d leads to death. Proverbs introduces Wisdom and Folly, a wise, moral woman and a foolish, promiscuous woman, as obvious foils. When Jesus rolls around, he accepts that pairing, but he flips it. No longer are fools and sinners outside God\u2019s party. Because Jesus is the friend of everyone who can\u2019t earn their way in, his only foils are the Pharisees, the ones who pretend they can earn it with their own wisdom.</p><p>When Jesus defends his strange behavior, he tells the crowd, \u201cblessed is anyone who takes no offense at me\u201d (Mt 11:6), because he\u2019s a scandal. St. Paul said that the cross was impotence and idiocy to humans, but to God, clearheadedness and might (1 Cor 1:25). Jesus didn\u2019t do wrong, but he endured humiliation and incrimination so that he could get on our level, in all our secret selfishness and vagrant desire. He welcomes us where we are, even when we\u2019re in Folly\u2019s house.</p>"

To die with Christ is to rise with Christ\u2014a new creation, a child of God, a person redeemed and saved by Christ himself.</p><p>But it\u2019s even more than that.

Contrary to what you might infer from the walking-corpse-filled pantheon of <i>Living Dead</i> films, the dead can\u2019t sin. That\u2019s the reality and release of the grave.

In the same moment that sin enters the world, God promises that he will one day overcome it (Gen 3:15). <i>Jesus</i>.

    "text": "<p>In terms of animal imagery, Jesus tends to find the most hopeless, aimless animals to tell us who we are. Sheep, as any shepherd can tell you, are not particularly bright. They wander off. They get things stuck on their heads. They are vulnerable and dim. Chickens, for all of their yard bird charm, are downright mean to each other. In the 21st century, we think of these animals as bucolic characters in a farmland bedtime story, baking bread and griping that nobody helped them (The Little Red Put-Upon Hen) or leaping across fences to lull us to sleep. We feature them in mattress commercials and decorate baby nurseries with fluffy, clean versions of these barnyard friends, but deep down, we know that if an actual sheep entered our house, there would have to be a steam cleaner involved at some point.</p><p>In Jesus\u2019 time, though, when at least one baby was <i>actually</i> born among farm critters, there weren\u2019t likely any illusions about the livestock that lived among them. Jerusalem, whose people were killing prophets and stoning those sent to help them, wasn\u2019t quite ready for a self-sufficient life in the wild. And Jesus doesn\u2019t tell the people that he wants to straighten them out, or that he expects better of them. He longs to gather them under his wing. He longs to protect us with the instinct of a mother hen.</p><p>For all of their less flattering characteristics, mother hens are notable for protecting their young. They have been known to fight off other animals to protect their chicks, and they have even sacrificed their own lives in the face of extreme danger (like fires), keeping the chicks safe even when they could not save themselves. God longs to pull us under his wings, not like a loud and boastful rooster, but like a mother hen. God longs to protect us from danger, and from our own self-destructive baby-bird-ness. And God\u2019s desire to protect us from ourselves, of course, extends to the destruction we may cause for others, with literal or virtual stoning. God\u2019s love embraces and protects those in destruction\u2019s path, even, or more likely especially, when those perpetrating violence are not willing to be gathered under God\u2019s wing.</p>"

Most builders use plumb lines to make sure their walls are perfectly straight, but don\u2019t let the simple tool fool you. A plumb line and a bit of trigonometry could build massive arches, fantastic coliseums, and ornate temples. Regardless of the structure, walls that lean, even a little bit, are in danger of collapsing.</p><p>The prophet Amos has a vision, in which God uses a plumb line to measure the \u201cuprightness\u201d of Israel. God discovers that the spiritual walls of Israel are about to collapse. \u201cI will never again pass them by,\u201d says God, meaning, he can\u2019t ignore the dangerously crooked walls any longer. They need to be torn down. God isn\u2019t wrong\u2014earlier in Amos, we discover that Israel has been oppressing the poor, ignoring the Ten Commandments, and embracing religions that practiced child sacrifice. Shaky walls indeed.</p><p>God\u2019s judgment is scary. Imagine the God of the universe measuring your spiritual uprightness, dropping a plumb line in your life. We might not be sacrificing children, but our spiritual walls are nonetheless crooked. Whether we are selfish, arrogant, or otherwise self-possessed, or whether we are just \u201canother brick in the wall\u201d (Pink Floyd) of a questionable cultural practice, the verdict is the same: These walls are destined for destruction.</p><p>The good news is that a plumb line is a tool used for both tearing down and building up. God isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands dirty, to rebuild our walls and lay new foundations with Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection as the cornerstone. May God renovate your spirit and repair all that is exposed by his divine plumb line.</p>"

Still, when Zechariah staggers out of the Holy Place after his unexpected audience with Gabriel, some kind of holiness must shimmer off of him, because the waiting people realize he has seen a vision (v. 22). Perhaps there are worse things in life than to enter into an enforced silence as we reflect on God\u2019s power and grace.

That reminder might also come with a hint of condescension from an eye-rolling judge, so attorneys usually don\u2019t forget their professional garb more than once.

We don\u2019t claim to be anything other than what we actually are; we just express a childlike desire to be in the light of Christ. Or as Paul says, \u201cFor once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light\u2026\u201d The hymn and scripture describe a beautiful picture; and only God has the power to make it so.</p><p><i>Heavenly Father, please draw our hearts to you, guide our minds, fill our imaginations with your light; through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Whether we were born on the wrong side of the tracks or born with a silver spoon in our mouths, the place of our birth means nothing in the kingdom of heaven. No heavenly time is spent assessing your accent or sports team fandom, and no heavenly algorithm is processing your zip code to determine whether you will enter through the pearly gates.

At a moment when they appeared to be in total control, they went bottoms up. All their coolness, poise, and power vanished in an instant, but was forever captured on thousands of iPhones. Steven Tyler was singing \u201cWalk This Way\u201d when he almost fell off the stage! They are not as powerful as we think. They\u2019re only human beings, just like us. Prancing around and posturing does not change the fact that, at any moment, the illusion of control may be shattered. Life has a way of coldly exposing our weaknesses. We judge these bottoms-up moments to be the clear low points of our lives.</p><p>The gospel views our weaknesses differently. Human weakness is how God gets things done. Our normal assumption is that things get done through the direct application of power, through force of will\u2014violent force, if required. If you want to get anything done, from changing the leadership of a foreign country to finding a new job, the way to make it happen is to <i>just make it happen</i>. Impose your will by force. This will result in victory, says the world. That\u2019s just how things get done.</p><p>Then along comes God. God operates differently. The Bible records a long history of how God uses seemingly insignificant circumstances, weak and overlooked people, and bottoms-up moments to work His will. The Apostle Paul was confident that God was getting things done through the small, weak and seemingly insignificant congregations to whom he wrote his letters.</p><p>None of Paul\u2019s churches were impressive from a Roman point of view. His congregations were full of weaknesses: divisions, lawsuits, sexual immorality, failure to care for the weak, conflicts over worship, drunkenness at the Lord\u2019s Supper, terrible theology, senior wardens going after other gospels. Folks were constantly falling off the stage. Nevertheless, Paul could see the Lord at work through those weaknesses. In the face of human weakness, Paul held tightly to the Lord\u2019s promise: \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for [my] power is made perfect in weakness.\u201d</p>"

Not a single moment of the story was out of his control, despite his human frame. He was the infinite infant God, wrapped in a robe of swaddling clothes. All the power of divinity resided in the weakness of a weaning child. The magi, then, confirm for us that the baby bouncing on Mary\u2019s knee was the King of kings. He was the promised and predicted Christ, the only wise Lord, at whose sight one day every knee will bow (Phil 2:10-11). The baby adored by foreign stargazers was the sovereign Savior whose mission was to relieve the world of its sin and renew it through his passion and resurrection. The wise men are, therefore, indicative of the wideness of the mercy of God, who would establish, through his own death, a kingdom of all nations, kindreds, and tongues.
