     "verseText": "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day. ",
     "text": "Formless and empty. None of us would want these words said   about our apartment. We certainly wouldn’t choose these words for our epitaph. Sometimes, though, it is exactly how life feels. Emptiness often feels like the default setting, so much so that we search for things to create to give us shape and meaning: careers, relationships, money, children, good health. We come to realize in this passage that true shape and meaning are things only God can provide."
