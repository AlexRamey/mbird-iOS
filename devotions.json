		"text": "'Formless and empty.' These are the two words that the writer of Genesis uses to describe the world, pre-creation. They are frightening words. Enter God the Creator. He brings shape and substance to the void. He creates something where there was nothing.\n\t'Formless and empty.' None of us would want these words said about our apartment. We certainly wouldn’t choose these words for our epitaph. Sometimes, though, it is exactly how life feels. Emptiness often feels like the default setting, so much so that we search for things to create to give us shape and meaning: careers, relationships, money, children, good health. We come to realize in this passage that true shape and meaning are things only God can provide. \n\tOur pursuits, the means of meaning, amplify the feelings of emptiness, hurting us and those around us. We know this from experience, religious or otherwise. Doing a good job becomes workaholism. Taking care of ourselves becomes vanity. Getting involved in good causes becomes self-righteousness. The list goes on, and no amount of self-esteem or positive thinking can help us. As Ted Boynton says in the movie Barcelona, 'Positive thinking is fine in theory. But whenever I try it on a systematic basis... I end up really depressed.'\n\tThis is the Gospel, the love of Christ found even in the creation of the world: that God brings us back to the place where our formlessness and meaningless is overcome. How do we know this? The most dramatic evidence is Jesus Christ, God made human. In Jesus, God comes to us even though it means death at our hands. And he overcomes death, the moment when life becomes formless and empty. He shows us his love has the power to recreate. \n\tHave you felt formless and empty? Have you wondered if God loves you? Have you wondered if God could exist amidst all this suffering and chaos? \n\tBe reminded, God is pursuing you with a love that conquers all chaos, formlessness and meaninglessness. His pursuit is not dependent on what you do or fail to do. His pursuit is based in unfettered love. Jesus’ death on the cross and his resurrection tell us that God’s love for us is real and that He has done all the work. He is faithful to us even when our lives seem to say otherwise. \n\t—K.

		"verseText": "God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.’ God said, ‘See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.’ And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good.",
		"text": "If you look around your world, what do you see? People colliding into one another as they go about their daily lives, adapting and reacting. Simultaneous and fragmented moments of happiness for some and catastrophe for others. Mostly bad news clips on television screens. General reminders of decay. We see entropy. \n\tGenesis instead sees the world in story. The story isn’t there to cover up or explain away all the present moments, but it is still there, no less real than our own experiences. We are called to see it as our world’s origin story—one not beginning with decay, but with creation and the repeated word 'good.' In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and the seas and the vegetation and all the living creatures, and each time, 'He saw that it was good.' Finally, of course, he created us, human beings, and he saw that it was all 'very good.' This created goodness sets the stage for our story. At the very outset we are assured that creation and goodness, not disaster and decay, is the heart of existence. \n\tNow, to view reality through the lens of this story is an irrational thing. It is hopeful in that it ascribes meaning, but at the same time it doesn’t shield us from pain. We cannot, any more than anyone else, alleviate suffering by 'remembering the story.' We find no comfort in shrugging our shoulders and saying, 'it’s just a part of the story.' And this makes sense: even though we believe the story to be real and believe we’re in it, we cannot force the plot to our advantage. Therefore the sting of disaster is all the greater, at least until one day it is all made new. But for that we must read on.\n\tFor now, suffice it to say, goodness is the objective root of reality. Augustine wrote in his Confessions, 'You made us for yourself and our hearts find no peace until they rest in you.' There is in the created order always still a presence of goodness, even in its restless absence. That’s the thrilling news we get from the beginning. And, as the story tells us, we don’t just find it here—He has written it all over creation. As Luther reputedly said, 'This was the purpose of springtime.' \n\t—Ross Byrd"

		"text": "There are three enormous—colossal!—ideas presented right here at the Creation. And they all have colossal implications for people personally.\n\tThe first idea is that God creates us in His image. Somewhere in us is the 'look' or image of God. It must be smothered, like the meat in a gigantic 'signature' cheeseburger, with French onion rings, A-1 sauce, gorgonzola, and bacon strips. But it’s there! Underneath all the built-up surfaces and rationalized cosmetic add-ons of defended selves, we are, underneath everything, made in the image of God. This gives us, and the people who love us, something to go on and work with. In the words of Joe Meek, 'It’s hard to believe it, but it’s true.' \n\tThe second idea is that the division into men and women is a primary fact of life.\n\tSo primally important is it, this distinction, that it comes only just after the statement of our founding. It is core, in other words. Now I may not particularly like this, and it might not be exactly how I might have done it if it were up to me, but it’s reality. We are either men or women. Incidentally, the fissure of this fact in human history has sometimes been a kind of nightmare for Christianity. Many on the outside of faith today would say that confusion about sex, or rather, a negative attitude towards sex, is the chief obstacle to their becoming a Christian. The famous Aldous Huxley said this in the 1930s, when he wrote that the men and women of his generation who rejected Christianity had rejected it mainly because they thought it was negative toward their idea of how they wanted to live in their sexual selves. Yet Genesis is not a 'no' to anyone, nor is it a judgment, but a descriptive bifurcation in the order of life.\n\tThe third idea in these verses is that God blesses man and woman who are made in His image. Now we all know that original sin is not the same as 'original blessing.' Personal experience has exposed to us the deep fault lines of human nature. I don’t often see a lot that God—Glorious in Majesty—could, if He were me, desire to bless. In other words, the God of standard and law could not possibly bless the inhabitants of this Malthusian world, let alone the chief inhabitant of this Malthusian world, me. I don’t deserve it, and don’t see anybody else out there who could deserve it either. As far as I am concerned, the 'glass' of human personality and behavior is half empty. And yet, God blesses the people He has made. He did it in the Bible’s first chapter, and it’s not in small print.\n\tI think this is a word that could temper one’s pessimism. Moreover, over the long term of a human life, God’s blessing probably amounts to, well, God’s grace.\n\t—Paul Zahl"

A Golden Smog song called 'Think About Yourself' (from Another Fine Day) goes:\n\nEvery night you close your eyes\nYour head is filled with alibis and rules to play,\nEverywhere I turn I see the bridges \nThat you’ve burned just to be free again.\nThis is so obviously a bitter-love breakup song, but it’s a breakup song with theological implications—the best kind of breakup song. I actually believe God wrote this song about me! All I do is think about myself, and it’s a surefire ending, just like the song forebodes: bridges burned, nowhere to turn, stuck on a road-blocked island of my own making. All because I thought the freedom I knew was the freedom I needed. I’m rescued time and again, without fail, yet it brings me to just one more chance to prove myself. I can do it, autonomously—watch! \n\tI read a book by Henri Nouwen that talks about his experience working in a community of the mentally and physically handicapped. He describes a highly touted, upper-echelon type of career in academia, his unfulfilling success, and his move into a facility where his medals, keynote addresses, his qualified abbreviations, were a wash amidst the daily routine of feeding adults, cleaning soiled sheets, saying nothing. In retrospect, he describes that the experience 'forced me to let go of my relevant self—the self that can do things, show things, prove things, build things—and forced me to reclaim that unadorned self in which I am completely vulnerable, open to receive and give love regardless of any accomplishments.' The Spirit moves not in our self-ordained notions of autonomy, but in our naked and common need. \n\tThis Genesis passage narrates the beginnings of people, and it’s a beginning that moves in the opposite direction of accomplishment and seclusion. At the very foundation of our existence lies the Gospel: the Spirit of God moves and breathes life into that which had no life before. It’s not a narrative of elemental potential or possibility—the Scriptures don’t depict a well-intentioned person with poor skills and bad tools suddenly given the tools for success. It’s instead the miracle of breathing dirt into life and 'living soul' from existential nothingness. This is the beginning—that, as Nouwen says, 'God loves us not because of what we do or accomplish, but because God has created and redeemed us in love.' \n\t—Ethan Richardson"

		"text": "Who is woman? A question asked by men and women alike, of all generations. A question I ask myself, as a woman, one that is all too often defined by form and function. But we cannot isolate woman from man to answer this question, because the answer to who she is lies in her relation to him. And often the answer seems to be not really an answer at all. She is completely similar to him, yet utterly different; she is equal yet not interchangeable; she is of the same flesh and bone, yet a different person completely; she is comfort and challenge.\n\tThe best answer I can give to 'Who is Woman?' is: she is the first gift of grace. She is God’s first act of intervention on behalf of man. She would not only alleviate man’s loneliness, drawing him up and out of himself toward another, but would also be the means by which God would consummate His relationship to man—with them as one. Without her, there is no relationship between God and man; without her, loneliness prevails and the Bridegroom is left standing at the altar. Through this wonderful gift, God demonstrates to the whole of creation His love for this curved-in man who cannot help himself, who is otherwise stuck in his isolation. \n\tThe word used in Gen 2:18, 'Helper,' is the same word often used of God throughout the Old Testament. In her creation, in her name ('helper'), the themes of protecting, supporting, shielding, sustaining, delivering, comforting, and giving hope and blessing are contained. As God gently nudges Adam awake and brings Eve to him, Adam is delivered out of loneliness into communion; he is given hope and comfort. He is blessed. She imputes to him that which is intrinsically hers and that which he lacks. Apart from her, the story ends too early.\n\tIn Ephesians, Paul says about the union of man and woman, 'This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.' This truth reverberates through the books of the Old Testament and into the ears, hearts, and minds of the New Testament audience as well as into ours today. We were, like Adam, isolated, lonely, hopeless, and helpless. 'But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved' (Eph. 2:4-5). In Jesus, through his life, death, resurrection, and ascension, God demonstrates Himself to be our true helper. What is intrinsically His (righteousness), He imputes to us; we were estranged, yet He entered into the midst of it and called us and brought us into communion with Him at His expense. Man and woman, woman and man, we live because Jesus, being merciful and taking pity on our estate, died.\n\tAs it was in the beginning, so it is now: like Adam, we’ve been saved by grace.\n—Lauren R.E.

		"text": "In these verses from Genesis, a terrible thing happens. The writer says, 'they knew that they were naked'—and there it is, the first moment in which shame enters the human equation. Then, from an ashamed Adam a few verses later, 'I hid myself'—the first moment in which running away enters the human equation. These are the moments in which free disclosure is exchanged for the new norms of hiding and division. \n\tThose wise theologians of the 1960s—Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young—understood our hearts well when they sang, 'We got to get ourselves back to the garden.' But we can’t. That gate is closed with a fiery sword guarding it. It doesn’t mean we don’t try to get back in; we have a go at Nike’s Just Do It swagger; we train and are trained to be those Little Engines That Could (a children’s story that has driven generations of children into therapy); we repeatedly chug, 'I think I can.' If we just work hard enough, we say, we can restore what we’ve lost. \n\tBut finally, and often repeatedly, comes the 'Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown' (from another wise theologian), and as we’re stuck outside the gate in that age-old shame and separation, there comes the One who does for us what we can’t do for ourselves.\n\tWe know the feeling of being outside the gate. Theodore Parker Ferris, Rector of Trinity Church in Boston in the early part of the last century, was having dinner with a young man, and they were talking about the young man’s father, who was known to be a stern and exacting man.\n\tThe son said that when he had been in the Army, he had made a terrible mistake, gotten into trouble, and was given a dishonorable discharge. He knew that what he had done disgraced the family, and he was sure that his father would be outraged. But he also felt that he had to tell his father what had happened.\n\t'So I did,' the son said. 'I wired him and told him what happened. He sent a telegram back. The telegram had three sentences in it: I will stand by you no matter what happens. I will be there in the morning. Remember whose you are.'\n\tRight at this moment, outside the gate, the Lord Jesus stands with you. He is looking you in the eye. He is saying the same to you, even while you hide: 'I will stand by you no matter what happens. I will be there. Remember whose you are.'\n\t—Jim Munroe"

		"text": "At a recent rehearsal dinner, the father of the groom related his interpretation of this passage: 'We all know there’s a difference between naked and nekkid, don’t we? Naked means you don’t have any clothes on. Nekkid means you don’t have any clothes on and you’re up to something.'\n\tThose of us in the wedding party got a good laugh, pretending not to remember any time when that adjective might have been true for any of us. Surely it’s not one of those 'You had to be there' stories, because we have been there. This father’s toast—to a long marriage of mutual, unashamed vulnerability, with one another and with God—was not only refreshingly genuine and to-the-point, but also it recalled those nekkid times of discontent, the kind of discontent Genesis presents here in Adam and Eve’s predicament. Like ours, it is a predicament stemming first from the experience of having something withheld. \n\tTo have something withheld, or at least to be convinced that there is something being withheld, is one of the biggest impediments to trust and one of the most prodigious sowers of discontent. (Cite the prodigal son’s older brother for an easy example. Also cite any fifteen-year-old denied their iPhone and a later curfew.) This is the seed sown in the Garden. In these situations the 'offended' becomes wholeheartedly convinced that the withholders are, once again, trying to ruin their lives.  \n\tOf course, the gut-level discontentment often goes deeper: when prayers for a good doctor’s report, a better marriage, a breakthrough, a break are left unanswered. You fill in the blank: 'Why wouldn’t God want me to have (blank) right now?' The gamut runs on forever. \n\tFor sure, inasmuch as contentment is a blessing from the hand of God, so too is discontentment. Occasionally, our discontentment leaves us on our knees, praying less for what we want, and more for peace with whatever we’ve been given. Our wants put aside, we are left trusting that God gives us what we need. And when we reach for it and are left unsatisfied, looking for our proverbial fig leaf, we can trust in the unwavering grace of our Father. \n\tIn a sermon on the 23rd Psalm, Frederick Buechner says, 'Maybe ‘I shall not want’ means that, whatever else is withheld, the shepherd never withholds himself, and he is what we want more than anything else.' In not getting what we want, the Lord is our Shepherd still. \n\t—Addie Chapin"

There is a Time Machine quality to many wedding celebrations that is almost a completely positive quality—almost. \n\tLurking beneath the frivolity of each wedding celebration is the fact that both bride and groom, in varying levels to various guests, are known quantities—and this knowing can often serve as the emotional currency thrown around during the rehearsal dinner. One can overhear statements like, 'Good thing you didn’t know Bob-or-Sally back during the mid-80s,' 'We never thought that Bob-or-Sally would even survive college,' or the ever-popular 'Looking at them now, you would never think Bob-or-Sally ever had a serious problem with you-know-what.' \n\tThese varying degrees of knowledge are what make rehearsal dinners so anxiety-producing: because in most cases, Kappa-Kappa-Phi-Brother-Danielson and Childhood-Friend-Anne-Margaret have access not merely to funny, childish stories—like that one where Bob-or-Sally ate a whole tube of toothpaste on a dare at Camp Wildfire (can you believe it!?)—but rather the stories which splay out deep character flaws. Fortunately, some kind of goodwill keeps the lid on these stories, but sometimes, for all sorts of reasons, there are serious errors in judgment. \n\tThroughout each toast, Bob-or-Sally know that they are the subjects of the praising stories or the childish ones, but they are also people with histories, and thus are secretly afraid of being found out. \n\tIn many ways, that flash of fear captured in a rehearsal dinner mirrors a deeper fear that is addressed by the Gospel. Fear of exposure before God is based on a real past, with real stories that could easily come out if the wrong person grabs the microphone. This fear is not just some kind of psychologized guilt, but rather rooted in deliberate thoughts and actions that rightfully should condemn us. This is real guilt, and it breeds real, debilitating fear. This is when we go into hiding.\n\tInto this cycle breaks the message of the Gospel, the message that, on the cross, God has levied our embarrassing stories on the innocent, in our place, so that we stand known before God without fear or hiding. While the drama surrounding rehearsal dinners may never end, the message of the Gospel speaks clearly to the fears of knowing and being known. We can rest secure, knowing we are known in absolution, and that the mic has never been in better hands. \n\t—Jady Koch"

In the mystery of the Fall, the desire to be like God takes hold of the hearts of men and women. The serpent convinces them they need only themselves; all they must do is turn from Him and in on themselves. Thus, here in the first three chapters of the Bible, after the Fall, the need for and purpose of Christ is brought to bear (Gal 4:4).\n\tThe Bible describes God as jealous for people (Zech 1:14, 8:2). He is the curiously hot-pursuing lover of sinners, harlots, and tax collectors. He is the persistent wooer of those He lost in the garden, those shepherdless sheep. The Undesirables of this world are the apple of His eye. The weak ones the world rejects, He embraces.  \n\tAnd this promise is for you and me. He crushes the evil one on our behalf—the Hebrew promise means, 'to crush, or to batter.' While we inherit the Fall’s curse, God promises to strike the fatal blow upon our enemy, which He accomplishes on the cross for us. While serving as our atonement, the cross, too, is the death-dealing strike against the forces of hell. \n\tThe story starts here: this is the beginning of God’s hot-blooded pursuit of His dissolute people. But the cross is the great exchange; there Jesus steals our identity as sinners and defends us from the hopelessness of hell. He is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29).

By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.",
		"text": "This passage deals heavily, I think, with the ideas of occupation and purpose. I remember struggling with these concepts and feeling incredible pressure after graduating. Entering the 'real world,' in need of something to do and somewhere to work, I have often wondered if the nine-to-five was God’s intent when He made us. Is this where all my education and job training have lead me? What if I have a truer vocation, and that vocation is different? And what about all the people who have felt trapped in careers they don’t enjoy—did they make a wrong turn somewhere? Were they just not listening closely enough for God’s voice? \n\tEarlier on in Genesis, God creates Adam and gives him a job: 'The Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it' (2:15-17). My own experience of garden tending, however, more closely aligns with this passage, where God describes his curse upon the man—'Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.' \n\tIt seems that God has now changed things. It’s fair to assume that, before this point, Adam’s occupation was a pleasure—he didn’t know the shadowy stress of deadlines, the grinding fear of getting reamed by clients or bosses. He was nothing more or less than God’s gardener, planting and tending exactly how God had designed. Adam’s relationships to his occupation and to God were entirely free from condition or demand. \n\tThe curse forces Adam to eat through 'painful toil,' to work for his food in the midst of thistles and thorns. God has withdrawn His presence from Adam and Eve, their self-evident intimacy with their work cut off. The new system—the system we are still abiding in today—is a conditional system where 'effort in' equals 'reward out.'\n\tIt’s hard to understand how God could curse his own forever simply because they broke a rule. But it’s important to remember God’s chief purpose throughout all of Scripture—to reveal humankind’s need for rescuing. \n\tThough one day we may find that 'perfect' job, one where our interests and talents combine in a harmony of purpose and drive, we are not—and will never be—good enough, smart enough, or talented enough to stand beyond conditions. Children of Adam, something will always be required from us.

Here they were being told by God that, as a result of their disobedience towards Him when He gave them that one rule—'Do not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil'—they were about to have a host of hardships come their way.\n\tImagine for a moment the pain, the fear, the absolute sense of shame that Adam and Eve must feel. In the face of their angry, loving Maker, they must wonder if things can ever be the same. To make matters worse, they now stand before this God with the promise that pain and toil will mark the rest of their lives. Perhaps even worse than this, though, God promises them that they will die, that their lives will cease to exist; they will no longer enjoy the beauty of this garden. To top it all off, they stand naked and utterly exposed in their sin before God. \n\tThe more I reflect upon this story, the more I realize that I can easily relate to them. Every time I find myself in the place of having sinned against God—of having broken His divine Law (all too frequently, I must shamefully admit)—I, too, am racked by thoughts of fear and shame and find myself wanting to run away and try to hide from God.  The reality is that I don’t want to be seen by Him because I feel so naked in my sin before Him.\n\tAnd yet this passage speaks a word of hope into these moments when we find ourselves naked in our sin before God. At the worst point of Adam and Eve’s life, when God should rightfully have wiped them away for their sin, just done away with them and started over again, He does an amazing—albeit simple—thing: God clothes them! He doesn’t leave them naked in sin and shame. In the midst of terrible judgment, a glimmer of God’s grace comes shining through: He takes animal skins and makes garments for Adam and Eve to clothe their shameful nakedness.  In a single, mundane act, God gives them a taste of the wonderful plan He has in store for dealing with our horrific, inherited blight of sin.\n\tWhat is His plan? He will clothe us! He will not leave us alone in our sin and humiliation. And this is precisely what He has done through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ; He has clothed us, not with garments of skin, but with the righteousness that belongs to His son. God has covered us with a garment so clean and so perfect that not even a speck of our sin remains seen by Him.  So, in those terrible moments when we feel like Adam and Eve and wonder if we will be left exposed in the nakedness of our sin, see and hear the wonderful promise of God: 'I clothed Adam and Eve with garments of skin, but you I have clothed in the righteousness of my son. Your sins are forgiven, my child, simply because I love you that much.'\n\t—Kyle Tomlin"

God commands Cain to get himself together, to simply 'do well,' and in the very next verse (4:8), enflamed with resentment and jealousy and anger, Cain kills his brother. The impulse to self-mastery leads, ironically, to ever less control when filtered through the rebellious, untamable human heart.\n\tThe Apostle Paul knew this by experience, namely that his own 'sinful passions' were 'aroused by the law' (Rom 7:5), that the desire for control created rebellion, such that he was unable to do the thing he wanted to do and found himself doing the very things he loathed (Rom 7:15).\n\tIn our constant quest for peace, the answer is to be found not in the quest for control, but in the release of it. True peace only comes about when we receive the good news that in spite of our petty powerlessnesses and intractable addictions, however big or small they may be, we are loved and accepted; that we do not, in fact, control our own destiny, but rather our fate has been bought and our future secured by the cross of Christ. He is in control, even though we are not.\n\tAs we walk through life, constantly frustrated by our inability to be and do what we want, the answer is not self-mastery, but rather the love of the Master. We are not and will not be what we ought to be, yet God, through Jesus, says to us, over and over again, 'You’re not in control, but I am—and your future is secure in Me.'\n\t—R-J Heijmen"

		"text": "This infamous 'Tower of Babel' story in Genesis requires some theological unpacking, but it is worth the effort. The story has great relevance for us, for it reveals a significant and common error in religion. \n\tAt first glance, the Babel Project doesn’t seem all that bad. I suppose one could even say that those constructing the great Tower are doing something noble: unifying diverse communities with a common mission; having an impressive religious structure that would inspire people for years to come—touching heaven itself!\n\tWho would stand in the way of such a significant project? Why meddle with those who simply want to create something that will inspire others and lead them toward religion, toward God? Well, two things made this project doomed from the start. First, the builders wanted the tower to reach 'the heavens.' Second, the builders were using the Babel Project to 'make a name for ourselves.'\n\tIn the ancient world, many cultures would build ziggurats—tall, spiraled towers intended to reach up to the gods. The thought was if one could reach that high, the gods might be impressed, and the fates could be brought under human control. And this is the operative principle in most ancient—and modern—religious belief: if you can reach heaven, you control your destiny. \n\tHuman-oriented religion is by nature Babel-directed. That is, in the guise of religiosity, we naturally believe in our control over 'upward mobility.' We climb ladders and build tall towers to grab at what will make us noticed, respected and loved. Like the Babel Building Company, we do this in order to 'make a name' for ourselves, in order to control what is beyond control. (Remember, Adam and Eve fell only so much as they reached—or climbed—for what was not theirs.) Raw ambition seems part and parcel to the human plight, even from the beginning, and ambition disguised in religious apparel is a very dangerous thing. \n\tInterestingly, while our natural religious inclinations were moving up to the heights of glory, God was on His way down. Christianity believes in a God who 'came down' in Jesus Christ to save His people. The Apostle Paul said that Jesus 'did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross' (Phil 2:6-8). Christians believe that God lowered Himself to the limits of humanity, and made Himself known, not in the heights of human ambition, but in the depths of pain, sin and death. \n\tThe fact that God came down while we’ve struggled 'up' shows us the futility of the Babel Project. Why? Because God’s not there. If you want to climb upward for God, the only hill to climb is Calvary, where we find religious death—the end of our climbing ambition—and true, abiding rest. \n\t—Ethan Magness"

And Abram said, 'Behold, thou hast given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.' And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, 'This man shall not be your heir; your own son shall be your heir.'

However, I have come to understand that fact very positively: all the good things important to me in my life right now would not be there had I 'succeeded' more, whether in school or work or relationships. You would think that such a realization would strengthen my faith in God, but when things go wrong I still get angry at Him. I still doubt whether He is there, whether He cares; and then I feel guilty for getting mad, and worry that He will—or has already—abandoned me, as I have Him.\n\tBut there is tremendous comfort in this passage for a faith running on empty. It is not that Abram is some role model for us to emulate or compare traits with. He is not some superstar on faith steroids, batting 1.000 with record homeruns in the belief big leagues. No, he’s really just a double-A dugout doubter like me. Time and again—in this passage, in telling Pharaoh his wife was his sister, in sleeping with Hagar—Abram doubts God’s promise of provision. And yet, time and again, as God does with us, He takes Abram by the hand, reminds him of the promises that will never waver, however frail his faith in them may be—and that is enough for Abram to be reckoned righteous.\n\tThe point is that even our faith is not something we do; it is in our nature to resist it and take our lives into our own hands. 'Many Christians,' the late Paul Tillich noted, 'feel anxiety, guilt and despair about what they call ‘loss of faith.’ But serious doubt is confirmation of faith.' While a strong faith is a wonderful comfort when we feel it, even doubt is proof of God’s love for us. The good news is that God never abandons us, and the proof is not in the stars, but rather comes to earth on the cross, where in the most monumental 'failure' of all time, our plans, expectations, and fears meet their end. In that moment everything that ever needed to be done was done once and for all.\n\t—Leonard Finn"

It is a completely laughable scenario. \n\tIn fact, when God reveals to Sarah and Abraham His master plan of redemption, that the Messiah, the promised One, the Savior of the whole world would come through their family line, they literally laugh at him. This initial laugh is not one of joy, but of scoffing pain. Sarah is barren. They are both very old. This simply does not happen. \n\tSo they take matters in their own hands. They decide to try to do God’s saving work themselves, in their way, at their time. Sarah tells Abram to go have a baby with her maidservant, Hagar. Soon Hagar gives birth to Ishmael. You can just hear Abram and Sarah saying, 'We did it! Thanks to this plan we put together, the Son of Promise is here! Oh, and by the way, thanks for the help, God!'\n\tAnd doesn’t that tend to be our salvific default mode too? 'I know the situation is grim, God! I’ll keep my part of the bargain and be a good boy and follow through with a plan to fix it, and God, you’ll keep your part of the bargain too, right?' \n\tWe flail and fail time after time, and after all our projects to fulfill God’s promise have been exhausted, God steps in and does the impossible. It’s no different here: 'And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac' (21:2).\n\tGod’s salvation is not a transaction, where we keep our part of the deal and God keeps His. No! Salvation is the one-way movement of mercy from God to us. It’s something God does in us and through us and to us, not something we do for God or for ourselves. Our salvation from our sin is not a partnership, and that is crazy good, laughable news.\n\tDoes God’s promise to save you, to love you, to keep you seem laughable today? If you’re honest, it probably should! The good news is that you can laugh that happy laugh right along with Sarah because our God keeps His promises—even the absurd ones. \n\t—Curt Benham"

'Where did you go to school?' strikes a similar chord, to name another common example. Life is unfortunately full of such tests. \n\tMaybe you’ve been in a relationship where someone is constantly testing you. Every late night at the office becomes a potential (wrong) answer to the question, 'Will you choose me over your career?' And when you’re at work, the boss evaluates your every move through the rubric of 'how committed to this company are you?' Or maybe there’s a parent that you feel you are always failing. Or perhaps you’re failing your own tests—the hardest of all. Whatever the case, it is an exhausting way to live, and we all know that an evaluative atmosphere produces self-consciousness at best and resentment at worst. \n\tThings are rarely much different when it comes to the Almighty. In fact, life can often feel like one long test from above. We perceive problems and difficulties as opportunities to show our spiritual stuff, our chance to make it clear just how much faith we’ve got—with divine blessing doled out in direct proportion to our faith. \n\tAt first glance, the story of Abraham and Isaac confirms our fears in this regard. God is testing Abraham—and how! It’s a horrifying passage, and not just because it involves a man putting a knife to his son’s throat. It’s horrifying because it paints a picture of test-passing faith that could not be more extreme. Indeed, if this is the 'leap to faith' (S. Kierkegaard) that God requires of His children, then who could approach Him with confidence? Those of us whose lives are more marked by faithlessness and fear than courage and confidence know that this is a test we will fail every time. That is... unless someone else would be willing to take it for us. \n\tThere is in the Bible another son being 'put on the wood,' another Father who was willing to sacrifice a beloved child, in spite of having every reason not to. But unlike Isaac, this Son was not spared. This is the Son who passed every test, the one whose faith never faltered, the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world. The world may test us, our colleagues may test us, our loved ones may test us, we may test ourselves. But God is not testing us. There is no test that He has not already passed on our behalf.

Suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright; then your sheaves gathered around it, and bowed down to my sheaf.'",

It’s one thing to have a dream about everyone in your family bowing down to you, and quite another to tell all of them about it, especially when, in the all-important birthright system of Joseph’s time, you’re at the bottom. Joseph is clearly self-impressed, and obnoxiously so. What traits does he even have, to make his father favor him when he’s clearly such an arrogant you-know-what? \n\tAccording to the Genesis account, he has nothing—of course he has some positive traits, but there’s a reason they are absent from this part of the story. Joseph’s position of honor has everything to do with his father and nothing to do with himself. He does end up learning humility through imprisonment and slavery. But the story is so compelling because it is Joseph’s weakness that God uses for him to end up in Egypt, and it is his suffering that produces virtue. Love, though, is independent of either, and it comes onto the scene here before suffering, before virtue, before accomplishment. Like much of the Bible, this story alights on weakness in order to dispel our persistent illusion that God’s love and ability to use us derive from our strengths.\n\tIsrael’s paternal preference for Joseph is arbitrary, gratuitous—foolish, even—and it’s exactly how God loved Joseph, and loves us. Even when God, in His grace, gives Joseph this dream to assure him of God’s love for him, Joseph is tactless, angering his brothers so much that they sell him off into slavery. But this merely 'gets the ball rolling' on the whole rambling, thirteen-chapter, redemptive tale. At no point could any of the brothers have guessed that the foolish preference of their senile father would save Israel from famine, and yet Joseph does. God uses even Joseph’s pride to save the family. He uses weak people, and He brings good from their weakness. God doesn’t choose us despite our failures, but rather through them. \n\t—Will McDavid"

In an act which can only seem vindictive, Joseph orders his brothers to bring back the family’s youngest son, Joseph’s brother Benjamin, before they get any grain. Joseph then frames Benjamin for a crime he doesn’t commit (sound familiar?) and orders him held in slavery. It’s like Joseph is testing them to see if they’ve learned their lesson.\n\tJoseph’s long-standing resentment against his brothers begins to fade when one of them stands in for Benjamin, offering enslavement in his place so that their father will not undergo so much grief. Seeing himself in his younger brother Benjamin, Joseph is touched by this act of mercy so much that he begins sobbing. He hugs his brothers in turn, simultaneously making himself known and forgiving each of them.\n\tReconciliation and forgiveness usually work this way. It’s not a determination to forgive someone that heals longstanding grudges, nor is it an apology, in and of itself. The source of forgiveness is love, pure and simple, and once we feel we’ve received it, forgiveness happens naturally—like Joseph, we can no longer help ourselves. \n\tJoseph feels love because he sees himself in his little brother—the youngest, the favorite, just as Joseph had once been. He sees the weakest of the family and loves him. Not only do the other brothers refuse to sell Benjamin, but also one of them goes so far as to give up his life to allow Benjamin to go unpunished for the 'theft.' \n\tLoving us and seeing the sorrow of the Father, Jesus chooses in love to be the stand-in in every situation in our lives, willing to become a slave and take our punishment in every area where we are condemned. This substitution means forgiveness—all of the brothers, including their father, are reconciled and invited as Joseph’s personal guests.

Abraham and Isaac lie about their relationships with their wives. Jacob’s very name means 'scoundrel,' 'supplanter,' 'deceiver.' Judah dishonors his daughter-in-law, then sleeps with her, taking her to be a prostitute. Simeon and Levi invite a village to become part of their family and then slaughter them.

They have reason to fear: not only had Joseph been wronged, but he is also one of the most powerful people in all of Egypt—and now, with Jacob dead, there is no longer a father to mourn the deaths of his sons. The stage is set for revenge. But that is not how the story goes. Instead, Joseph, with tears in his eyes, looks upon his brothers and forgives them.\n\tThis forgiveness is a radical concept today, and I can’t imagine it being any less scandalous in ancient Egypt. It is a scandal we know, too, on account of Jesus Christ. Like Joseph’s brothers, the words of forgiveness stand powerfully true, all the more after we act against them.

An image that recurs throughout the movie is that of the sacrificial fire, both cleansing its victims and appeasing its god. The victims of the fire have to kind of dive into it, in order to receive the benefit of their gesture. Fire is that way in ancient times. It purifies and cleanses. Even in vampire movies, fire has the power to cleanse those 'two little marks,' on the hand or on the neck, from their cursed effects. Fire is really wonderful.\n\tHere, in the encounter of Moses and the Lord on Mount Horeb, God is a fire that burns without consuming its object. It is fire without end. This means it is decontamination without end, the powerful visible sign of an urgently needed grace.\n\tThe Lord tells Moses, 'Do not come near... for the place on which you are standing is holy ground' (3:5). It is then that Moses hides his face and is afraid.\n\tYou can’t experience grace until you’ve experienced yourself. And 'yourself' is a person that the truth consumes. Personal truth is a terrifying thing, and nobody likes it. You can administer a painful truth to someone other than yourself, and it doesn’t sound like such a big thing from your point of view. But to the person concerned, to the person skewered by the truth, it is extremely unpleasant. It can make the recipient hate you and detest you. 'Got to get you out of my life,' to turn a Beatles lyric inside out. \n\tTruth about yourself is not only unwelcome. It is also consumptive, meaning truth consumes your illusions and rationalizations. This is why, for example, few 'interventions' in cases of addiction actually work. We’re taught they are supposed to work, and they should work. After all, they’re almost always motivated by love. But experience teaches that they more often fail. The 'interventionee' does not want to buy what the intervening truth is selling.\n\tGod’s message of historic love in Exodus 3, which is step one in His plan to extricate the Hebrews from their bondage, consists of a fire that does not consume and a voice that does not scold. 'I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and have heard their cry' (3:7). Moses the seer and hearer was not consumed, and he was also reassured.\n\tIt is a profound mystery: Sherlock Holmes’s 'The Case of the Burning Bush': not your everyday case of extortion or blackmail, but rather a case of fire that leaves the witness alive and sings, 'God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay.' \n\t'Fear not, then,' says the angel, 'Let nothing you affright.'

Providence brings a re-run of the 1956 classic, The Ten Commandments. \n\tSetting Charlton Heston aside, close your eyes and imagine this southern preacher’s hot, cramped, creaky-floored church and listen for that old pastorly cliché: 'Friends, what Red Sea are you facing today?' \n\tIn reflecting on the temptations we’ve faced and the sufferings we’ve undergone, no doubt we’ve been faithless amidst life’s domestic complexities. Juggling home, career and family; coming to terms with illness, debt, death—it hasn’t gone too well. We’ve not laid our burdens down like we should have. And with this failure comes shame. Hold that thought. \n\tImagine helicoptering into this Red Sea situation, commando style, for a Barbara Walters cover story. These people—God’s people—have known nothing but slavery for four hundred years. Suddenly the God they forgot comes to deal with Pharaoh. After the chilling plague narratives, Pharaoh relents, Israel packs up, and bonfires line the beach of the Red Sea. But of course it’s not over there. In the throes of megalomania, Pharaoh changes his mind and chases after them. Now God’s people stand hemmed in, at an impassible Red Sea and without water wings.\n\tWe often have similar experiences where we feel this close. We had great plans, and we almost got there, but now the hope of deliverance seems too good to be true—and now it’s back to the old life. \n\tIn these moments of regress or failure, nothing quite pegs our identity like shame does. It becomes the way we self-describe. The 'Who am I?' framework only shows us what we aren’t: an ineffective employee. A failed father. A basket case. A pervert. Your shame has the power to terminally name you. Sure, Jesus-loves-me-this-I-know and all that—but what about here and now? What about this sea of shame?\n\tIn Christ, you are God’s treasured possession. As part of His family, you are the beloved first-born son. Rather than receiving the wrath of Pharaoh, the chaos of the sea is the moment of His salvation. Naturally you’ve forgotten that and have placed an old shame back onto your shoulders again, but it was never yours to lug around in the first place. As Jesus says, 'My yoke is easy and my burden is light.' In Christ, you are clothed in righteousness and when God sees you, there’s nothing more to be ashamed of. He sees the perfection of Jesus.\n\t—Matt Johnson"

		"text": "This sentence is Moses’ final instruction before he leads the Israelites through the Red Sea. The Israelites are being pursued by a large and powerful army, and their way forward is blocked. There is no apparent way out of their situation, so Moses tells them to 'be still' and to watch for deliverance. Moses tells the Israelites that God will fight their battle. \n\tThe extent to which we believe that the LORD will fight our battles determines our ability to be still. Who among us, however, is inclined to be still when we are under attack? Whether under an emotional or physical assault, our natural response is either fight or flight. Our minds begin to race, and our bodies go taut. \n\tWith the Israelites, neither fight nor flight is a realistic option. Pharaoh’s army is vastly superior to the Israelites, so any engagement would mean sure disaster. They cannot flee, as they are boxed in between the Red Sea and the oncoming army. It seems the Israelites will be still because there is no other choice. God has made them still by their circumstances. \n\tThankfully, God also makes us still. When we are boxed in, important realities are revealed. We see the magnitude of our battles and the limits of our ability to overcome them. We see that things are actually out of control—our control. Because we are so terribly human, it usually takes exhausting all our options to make us still and inactive. \n\tMartin Luther addresses this stillness in Thesis 18 of the Heidelberg Disputation. 'It is certain that man must utterly despair of his own ability before he is prepared to receive the grace of Christ.' Stillness is the fruit of recognizing our inability. Stillness in a world of incessant human effort is unnatural, but it is God’s good gift to His people. Stillness is what we find at the foot of the cross, where we admit our impotence and anticipate the revelation of God’s power.\n\t—Kemp Hill"

The Exodus and subsequent journey to the Promised Land are the great moments of deliverance in Jewish history. As it is written in the Psalms, 'Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works in man’s behalf! He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot—come, let us rejoice in him' (66:5-6). For thousands of years now, Jews remember and celebrate that God took them from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land. At the last minute, on their way out of Egypt and to the Promised Land, God divided the Red Sea—had God not provided, they would have died.\n\tTo Christians, the Exodus foreshadows the ultimate story of deliverance. It points to the cross—the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as 'the work of God on our behalf.' The Exodus and the ministry of Jesus both tell us that God provides for those in need, and that God causes life and flourishing where death and destruction try to reign. The Exodus and the cross tell us that God’s operative principle is rescue. God comes near to us—down here in the thick of it—to rescue us.\n\tThere is no work we can do in exchange for this rescue: it is undeserved and unearned. As the psalmist highlights the mighty works of God on our behalf, so we see this fulfilled in Christ. Jesus, who came to 'fulfill the law,' did the work we couldn’t do, on our behalf. We could never be good enough. We could never fulfill the righteousness required by the Law. God, in the person of Jesus, did the work we couldn’t do for ourselves, and so God attributes Jesus’ work as our work. God exchanges our sin for Jesus’ righteousness. The work of God on our behalf is the best news possible to those in need of rescue.\n\t—Justin Holcomb"

It sums up the words of the people to Moses and Aaron reported in the sixteenth chapter of Exodus. \n\tThey have fallen so low. They have been delivered categorically from their real-world oppressors, and then have seen the Red Sea part, miraculously. Now they are afraid they won’t have enough food to survive. They blame Moses, together with his reluctant pal, Aaron. Moses himself, by the way, has been reluctant right from day one. He knows the heart of a man, and he knows what he can expect in this thankless task of exodus: a reluctant, persecuted people following a reluctant leader. Wanting to blame somebody, the Israelites turn against Moses. Despairing and with nothing more to lose, they think, Why don’t we just kill him, and elect somebody else. If he fails, then we can kill that one, too. How low can you go?\n\tThis pattern repeats throughout the Old Testament: the people beg for a leader, a deliverer—then they disobey, or revert to child-sacrifice, or form cults 'under every green tree' (Isa 57:5). The people of the Old Testament are constantly rising, then falling, then rising, then falling. I don’t see how one can read the recession-regression chronicles of the Old Testament kings without having an honest view of human nature. The people then were no different from us. Our problems, the internal ones, stay with us from birth to death. Some excellent psychological rearrangements are possible, such as when you hear the Word of Grace or feel it embodied within a graceful person or persons. But we never cure our sinful human nature.\n\tI see recidivism in non-Christians as well as Christians. St. Paul recognizes it in Romans chapter seven, in his portrayal of the universal human being (as did Donovan—'The Universal Soldier'—listen to it), who slips back, within herself or himself, all the time. \n\tThe historical fact that Jesus was given to the world, given this personal and meta-history of us each and all, is the wonder of saving life. It is the only way out of this that I can see, for it is fully tuned in to the very high and deep frequency of universal stumbling. 'How loooow can you goooo?'\n\t—Paul Zahl"

In other words, we’re really angry at someone or something else, and we just direct our big anger at a littler object. It never does anyone any good, despite its rep for being a motivator. It gets the angry person in a most uncomfortable frame of mind and simply hurts, like a bullet of molten lead, the person to whom it is directed.\n\tI, for one, do not think anger is a good thing. It is, however, a real thing.\n\tThe Israelites’ anger at Moses throughout the Book of Exodus is classic. It keeps erupting out, the free-floating emotion that it is. It is really anger at God, as Moses observes here. He means to say, 'Don’t get angry at me. Get angry at God, who sent me, and who rescued you, to your apparent dissatisfaction.' And it does no one any good: the people are clearly impossible. They sound unsatisfiable, carping, and accusatory. And Moses cannot create water. Only God can do that, as God does next, when he bids Moses strike the rock.\n\tWe used to say that anger is therapeutic. 'Let it all hang out.' 'Vent!' 'Sick it up' (an English-ism), and so forth. But anger’s really not therapeutic. Anger is real, yes. But anger expressed at other human beings is actually a 'must' to avoid. If you’ve done it recently, you may have found that the collateral damage of anger vented can be high.\n\tI recommend we express our anger at God. He can take it. He is in the 'business' of absorbing it. 'No one does it better.' Jeremiah expressed his anger at God. Paul expressed it in a plaint concerning his 'thorn in the flesh.' Jesus almost did it—but not quite. Rather, Christ expressed his dereliction to the Father. The psalmist seems often on the verge of expressing anger at God. Oh, and Studdert-Kennedy did it, that old 'Woodbine Willie,' in his immortal spiritual poems from World War One.\n\tTry it. For a second, stop blaming the 'SOB' ruining your life, and instead blame God, who, by definition, must be pulling the strings. It will be for your good to have done so, though I don’t expect anyone to pick up on that until... 'Afterward' (Edith Wharton).\n\t—Paul Zahl"

I am like the Israelites in Exodus. God miraculously rescues them from slavery in Egypt, and no sooner does the Red Sea settle back into place than they begin complaining about their situation in the wilderness. They get thirsty and forget that God can move the ocean on their behalf. They get hungry and forget that God changed bitter water to sweet.\n\tI am no different. When I come up against difficulty, my knee-jerk reaction is not faith in God, but faithlessness. When I have a bad day at work. When the market has record drops in one day.

We have absolutely no personal say-so in His department, unless He 'gives us leave.' \n\tYet there is no guarantee of that. \n\tWhat took place at Sinai, when the Lord drew an absolute, un-passable boundary between Himself and the people, is that He made clear He holds all the cards. There is a complete distinction between Creator and creature, and this little piece of ancient history embodies that truth. If you were even to lay one finger for one second on the actual mountain of God, the large pile of created stone and hill where God was going to speak enduringly, you would die. And you would be so corrupted and tainted, through that little piece of terminal disobedience, that your body could not be touched by another. You would have to be shot with an arrow—killed without bodily contact from the executioner, in other words—or hit on the head with a stone, again without bodily contact. Disobedience and impurity: a 'lethal cocktail.'\n\tWhat this says to me is that some things, a few things, are serious. I like to lighten things up with humor. Sometimes the humor is well received. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes my humor masks an element of aggression. Sarcasm does this.\n\tBut I have watched sometimes when something I think is funny is definitely not funny to someone else. My little joke falls flat. Why? Because the particular theme is so serious to the other person that it’s almost sacred. No mocking, no deprecation, no sly aside. There are some serious things in life, even if we each define serious differently, based on our individual experience.\n\tWhat is really serious for you? What is the non-jokeable subject? Whatever it is, it is something that someone else comes close to at his peril. And I’ll tell you what the really serious element in life is: it’s where you have been hurt. It’s the wounded place, the open wounded place, predominantly from the past. That’s the place you may have fenced around, which, when someone comes near, he or she is 'stoned or shot.' \n\tFortunately, God didn’t stay this way. He broke down the border himself, and He 'rent the veil of the Temple in twain' (Mark 15:38). But only after Jesus was, well, stoned and shot.\n\t—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "John Calvin famously said that the human heart is an idol factory. Although we may deny it, we are desperate for someone or something to tell us what to do, how to live. If you don’t believe me, take a look at the books that people around you are reading the next time you’re on a train or airplane. I guarantee that a majority will be of the self-help variety, instructions for the inner idol.\n\tYet, strangely, when we are told what to do, we either ignore the command, fulfill it begrudgingly (and fleetingly) or, perhaps most often, do the exact opposite. Instruction doesn’t work, even when it’s disguised as self-help or 'life-coaching.'\n\tSuch was the case with Israel, who, after receiving the Ten Commandments, the ultimate 'to-do (or perhaps not-do) list' from the ultimate Source, almost immediately did the exact opposite, breaking the First and Greatest Commandment, 'You shall have no other gods before me' (Ex. 20:3), by forging and worshipping a cow made of gold. Commandments don’t work, whether they come from an idol, a therapeutic book, or God Himself.\n\tThe truth is that although we may think that we need some good teaching or some good instruction, what we actually need is a Savior. The search for a better teaching, a better idol, a better self-help method is actually a defense mechanism. A defense against the truth about our sinful, rebellious selves and a defense against the God who did not come to instruct us, but to save us. Approaching Jesus as Teacher, rather than Savior, is the wrong course, as the so-called 'rich young ruler' discovered (Matt 19:16-23). We simply can’t follow the instructions and thus, like him, we end up walking away, moving on to the next idol, the next teaching, the next strategy.\n\tJesus comes to silence the idols, to debunk the myth that we can help ourselves, to cancel the commandments. He does not tell us what to do but rather bids us to trust that he has done and will do it all.

There may have been a time in your life when the hand of God seemed easy to detect. A turning point, a time when you were brought out of the proverbial desert and delivered from an unhealthy relationship, sickness, or job. But then something happened. The new job didn’t pan out. Another relationship fell apart. The sickness returned. Suddenly, you 'don’t know what has happened to him.' You feel abandoned and confused, and you find yourself asking, where did God go?! \n\tThese moments are much more common than most of us would care to admit. And like the Israelites, our patience is embarrassingly short and our faithfulness profoundly lacking. We move on. We regress. We focus our devotion somewhere more convenient and easier to control. We are constantly in the business of creating newer, shinier golden calves. \n\tWhere are you feeling God’s absence this week? Where are you feeling like a victim? Where is the idol factory at work, and what is it producing? Probably not what was intended. \n\tThe good news is that we may move on, but God does not.

Here’s the scene: Jesus has already ascended to heaven, and Stephen is giving the Pharisees a tongue-lashing for their hardness of heart, and he uses this golden calf narrative. What does he say? 'But our fathers refused to obey [Moses]. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.' After Moses disappeared for a while, 'That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf' (Acts 7:41). \n\tIt’s no different today. The heart kindles our minds and motivates our actions. Our actions have a tendency to mirror back to us the motivation of our hearts, exposing our idolatries. The Apostle Paul says, 'They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator...' (Rom 1:25). \n\tThe things to which we assign savior status cannot, for very long, carry God freight. The tricky thing is, contemporary idols can be good things, too, not just the Skid Row variety. Whether it’s whole food diets or urban mission work or foreign film snobbery, on the whole, our idol-worship, like the golden calf, is our pursuit of a means to control what is uncontrollable, to pigeonhole and barter with a God whose 'ways are not our ways' (Isa 55). \n\tIf you put all your hopes into your kids or spouse, they’ll buckle under the pressure and resent you. If you live for success on the job, the deadlines won’t stop, and you’ll run yourself into the ground. You can even throw orthodox Christian belief onto the pile. Because life disaster will come, and that kind of trouble isn’t some kind of theological riddle to be cracked. Our idols will always break our hearts. \n\tAs Saint Augustine wisely said, 'You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you.'

We seem to know only how to forget God’s provision. We lambast His promises and shake our fists, having our own idea of how we think it ought to go. We cannot bear a sustenance that does not fit our neat little pictures of sustenance. To put it simply, we trust ourselves more than we trust God. Although 'the righteous shall live by faith,' God’s promises always seem laughable to us; our eyes blind us and our ears deafen us to the gracious absurdity of it all. \n\tAlthough we writhe and wail with our Numbers disease, He stands true to His promises. He sent us Jesus Christ, providing the all-encompassing Yes to His wayward people. As with Abraham, our faith is all the righteousness we need. God did not condition His rescue promise on the proper conduct of His people, but ordained His rescue before we even misbehaved. Take comfort, then, if you are worried because you seem to have forgotten God, if you think your mistakes will exclude you from the promise. God is greater than your memory, and His patient promise endures above and beyond your hesitations and reservations. Be consoled when you don’t understand what is going on in your life or how God can be sovereign over it: spies spitting in the face of God’s promises do not stop God from doing what He will. \n\tLook to Christ the babe.

Balaam is a soothsayer (think palm reader) who charged people for his skills in divination. The King of Moab tries to hire him to curse the Israelites because he is afraid they will invade his land. So here is a pagan king hiring a pagan professional curse-dispenser to strike the people of God.\n\tThis account shows God in a strange light. God tells Balaam to go with the King’s servants, but when Balaam goes, God gets angry with him. However, if that’s as far as you go 'into' the story, you’ve only caught the second most important part, and you’ll miss the most important part. The second most important part is the problem of choice, i.e. Balaam’s choice as a sinner. The most important part of the story is... the donkey. Yes, the donkey. \n\tGod gives Balaam the option to go, but just prior to that had told Balaam that he shouldn’t go, because the Moabites want him to curse Israel. Balaam’s choice leads him right into God’s judgment. That’s the problem with sinners like us: a sinner making good choices is still a sinner. God tells Balaam in verse 32 that the reason He has opposed him is because Balaam’s 'way was perverse before me.' Strangely enough, that’s the very distinction between a theology of glory and a theology of the cross. A theology of glory tells us our choices can (and do!) sync up with God’s will. A theology of the cross tells us our choices never can. Heavy? Well, yes, but that’s why we need intervention.\n\tIn Balaam’s case, intervention comes through the donkey. The donkey sees the angel in the road, but Balaam can’t. Why would this be? Only because God arranged it so. When the donkey actually changes course and saves Balaam from this 'holy ambush,' he gets upset and beats the donkey. God opens the donkey’s mouth and it talks to Balaam, and only then does he see the angel and realize the peril he was in.\n\tGod’s ways are not our ways, and even when we think we are doing the right thing, very often it is the wrong thing. It happens all the time in our lives. If it happens all the time, what does this mean? What hope do we have?! We can never be 'saved' by our choice(s). We always need someone between us and our penalties. In Balaam-the-pagan-curse-dispenser’s case it was a donkey, ordained by God to keep him from judgment, but what about you and me? \n\tWe have been given a message that God can and has provided better than a donkey. God has intervened with Himself. God the Son was offered as a sacrifice to turn aside God’s holy and righteous judgment against a sinful and disobedient people—a disobedient people who chose to beat and kill him, much like Balaam with his beast of burden. To trust in the intervening cross, to believe in that 'precious flow that makes me white as snow,' is the product of grace indeed.\n\t—Ben Phillips"

If we believe that God is some cosmic Santa, perpetually weighing out our good and bad deeds, then we will most likely respond with either uncertain fear or righteous anger. If we think God is uninvolved in the world, then we will mirror God’s indifference with a dismissive yawn. Israel, having been delivered from 400 years of slavery, is promised by God to be given a 'land flowing with milk and honey' (Ex. 3:8). Upon arrival to the land, Moses reiterates God’s promise to Israel, but the people want scouts to explore the land and 'bring back report about the route [they] are to take' (Deuteronomy 1:22). The report of the land given by the spies is overwhelmingly good!\n\tBut the people do not believe the report and rebel, saying, 'The Lord hates us.' Moses reassures them that God will come through and deliver them yet again from their enemies and give them the land. Twice Moses assures the people of God’s goodness and faithfulness, and both times the people refuse to listen. They believe God hates them and claim that God has determined to annihilate them by the hand of an enemy army. The Israelites assume that God hates them, and so they rebel against God and reject His covenant. \n\tThe same is true for us: if we think that God hates us—is out to get us—then His promises will seem empty. It’s a matter of trustworthiness. I have a friend who is known to be constantly late to everything he is invited to. Because I think of him as a procrastinator in desperate need of a watch, when I invite him to something, I routinely tell him an earlier time. If you don’t trust a friend to keep a secret, you aren’t going to tell them anything personal. \n\tBut when it comes to God, we know that He is trustworthy. Because of Jesus we know that God has chosen to steadfastly love us in the midst of our unworthiness. Jesus did not come to condemn us, but rather came to save us from ourselves. God can be trusted. In light of such love, we can have the confidence that God will protect and support us in our despair and protect us from our enemies. \n\t—Todd Brewer"

It’s a true sentiment, but not in the way we normally think—Christians have, like all sinners, certainly made a decision for Christ, the decision to crucify him. We did it in self-righteousness, or jealousy, or because of the creeping sense of injustice or fear we feel when God loves sinners as indiscriminately as He has us. How can we develop a moral fiber, a religious identity, if God simply wastes His grace on those folks? Despite the fact that it is also our only admission ticket, we often don’t want that kind of God.\n\tThe decision that really matters is God’s. And God has made up His mind about us, His decisive crucifiers. His decision is irrevocable and categorical: 'You are my treasured possession.' With blood on our hands, God has changed it for good, so that we might have the assurance that we are claimed as God’s own.\n\tIt is not because of your looks, wit, or wealth that God claims you. Far from it. God wants you for Himself because God actually enjoys you. He doesn’t enjoy your sin—no one enjoys those entitled and discriminating tendencies any more than influenza—but He chooses to love you in spite of it.\n\tGod’s eternal choice to love sinners is nothing like a business transaction, where one wants to get the best for the least. God’s economy of salvation is inverse: He reaches out to the least to give of His best—that those least and lowly might celebrate new life.\n\tThis new life is the empowerment to live freely in a world claimed by the love of God. No longer slaves to sin or death or devil—or even to God’s own Law—we are irremediably free. We are a 'treasured possession' to God. Keeping you close to Him and guarding you with love and might, God’s heart is supporting you with love and favor.\n\tGracious Father, you give us your best, your very self.

There is a well-worn beeline from who you are to what you do. If you are stubborn, it is because your heart is stubborn. If you insist on your own way, if you draw line after line in the sand, if you are inflexible in relation to others, it is because your heart is stubborn.\n\tMost people can pretend for a while; you can grin and bear it in public for a period of time. But the real conversation erupts on the way home after the dinner party, doesn’t it? The man seated at your left, with whom you maintained 'polite conversation' is now the 'obnoxious egocentric bore' of your complaints.\n\tFacades help make society function, but they can’t last. The non-integration between what you actually are and what you do will wear you down. Non-integration always leads to the disintegration of a person. The heart always wins. A stubborn heart must finally lead to a stubborn face, a set jaw, and a furrowed brow. As U2 sings, 'You were pretty as a picture, it was all there to see, but your face caught up to your psychology.' If you believe that you can 'fake it ‘til you make it,' you will only be fooling yourself. You probably won’t fool others, and you certainly won’t fool God, who is always and ever interested in your heart.\n\tA stubborn heart, finally, is a heart that says 'no' to God and is the essence of sin. It is a heart that says, 'I will rule as I please, when I please.' If there is to be any hope for who we are and what we do, the help must be administered to the heart.\n\tThe Lord knows this, obviously. This is why God says to His people, 'Circumcise the foreskins of your hearts.' Physical circumcision isn’t enough; it might get you through the dinner party, but not the ride home. The heart must be circumcised. Yet circumcision of the heart is a physical impossibility! What can be done?\n\tWhat can be done is what the Lord has already done. The Lord has already 'set his heart in love' on you. Yes, it’s true that 'to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heavens of heaven, the earth and all that is in it.' But it is also true that you belong to the Lord, and that even in your stubbornness God has set His heart of love on you. And it is the heart of His prior love for you that circumcises your heart. \n\tWhat you cannot do for your own heart, God does for you through the power of His heart of love. A heart that knows that it is perfectly loved by God is a heart that is circumcised. It is a heart that gives way to God and gives itself away to others. It is a heart that integrates who you are and what you do. The heart always wins.\n\t—Paul Walker"

Some tried to renegotiate their debts for lower rates and extended schedules and others simply ran from their creditors because the debts had grown too big and beyond their ability to repay.\n\tI can relate. In the summer of 2007, I moved and was unable to sell or rent the condo that I owned in the former city. I could barely afford to keep making payments and was not able to sell the property at a price that would repay the loan. I feared that one month I would not be able to make the required payment and that the bank would take everything that I owned. In my financial indebtedness, which always seems to carry its own emotional components of insufficiency and bankruptcy, the proclamation of the Lord’s time for cancelling debt became good news to me in a fresh, new way.\n\tJesus’ death on Calvary proclaims that our debts before Him have been cancelled and forgiven.

		"text": "This is the sort of passage that at first sounds kind-of-nice but when it sinks in 'kind-of-scary.' God reveals His perfect standard and requires my obedience to approach Him. It’s like a visitor at the zoo who, having just watched a lion roar and spring into action, is then invited to stick her hand through the gate to pet his mane. Upon first reading this passage I wonder, What is God talking about—'not too hard?' Are we here talking about what Jesus summed up in Matthew 5:48, being perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect? Is God offering to accept these, my paltry attempts? Is this an offer to have me go 30% and He the rest? That doesn’t seem to jive with Jesus’ standard in Matthew, or God’s throughout the first 30 chapters of Deuteronomy. \n\tAnd the trying’s not everything. To make matters worse, even when I am trying to do the good, I fail. As Robert Farrar Capon wrote in The Parables of Grace,\nThe world’s deepest problem is not badness as opposed to goodness; it is sin, the incurable human tendency to put self first, to trust number one and no one else... when I crippled my children emotionally (or when my parents crippled me) it was not done out of meanness or spite, it was done out of love: genuine, deeply felt, endlessly pondered human love—flawed, alas, by a self-regard so profound that none of us ever noticed it (102). \nDoes this ring true? \n\tIn truth, this speech from God is riddled with conditions: if you love, if you walk, if you keep his ways, then you will live, then you will succeed, then you will be blessed. This is the way this writer thinks, and it is the way the world operates. If I work 90 hours per week, I will make more money; conversely, if I speed, then I pay the fine. This is the way we operate, but in reality there’s still discontinuity: hard workers still get laid off, and some speeders never get pulled over. If we are honest, our quid pro quo attempts at justice are riddled with the sin Capon describes. \n\tAnd yet here God encourages. Why? It is encouraging because the whole of this demand, the whole of Scripture, points to one man for all. In the midst of the blinding standard of perfection, the imminent death if you fail, God is proclaiming throughout history the fact that there is one who has fulfilled every possible permutation of righteous, holy, perfect love. He is God’s word to us, God’s own son Jesus, the final word of forgiveness and mercy. Nothing that God has called us to be is too hard for Jesus, who has given himself for that very purpose. We live in the freedom of God’s final word: I forgive you, I am with you. Whatever it might be today, it is too hard for you. It is not too hard for me. \n\t—Kate Norris"

		"text": "The Israelites are stranded in the middle of a wasteland, with their leader on death’s doorstep and a young, inexperienced Joshua waiting in the wings. Regardless of their place in world history, their predicament is not dissimilar to ours: no matter who you are, the future is always opaque and forbidding. After all, what comfort comes from the unknown? The best filmmakers know that nothing is more frightening to an audience than not knowing what comes next. Merely living life presumes an acquaintance with this kind of fear—we often ask ourselves questions that reveal this future-oriented anxiety: Where will I work? Will mom beat the cancer? What will become of our teenager? Where is God now?\n\tThis very concept is captured brilliantly by T.S. Eliot’s 'Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock':\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, \nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, \tand snicker, \nAnd in short, I was afraid.'\nUnlike Eliot’s Prufrock, it strikes me that we are often afraid even to acknowledge the simple truth that we are afraid. We resist this admission of weakness because we prefer the illusion of strength. Fear is a primeval motivator, but fear typically masquerades as strength: in an aggressive power hunger, an expensive sports car, excessive hours in the gym. We are basically afraid that by not asserting ourselves, we would need to depend upon God’s promise instead—we would need to believe that He is greater than whatever unknown we are currently facing. \n\tThinking on a larger scale, it is even possible to see the insidious traces of fear in the way consumers shop-till-they-drop, the way nations use a rhetoric of fear, the way churches insulate themselves from anything and anyone who might upset the proverbial apple cart. Yet Jesus routinely ventured into these fear-based motivations: what these people met in Jesus was a person who was simply neither afraid nor ashamed of his utter dependence upon God. 'The son can do nothing by himself,' he said (John 5:19). Neither can we. The only way we can experience this kind of surrender is to recognize God has been doing quite a good job at leading people through the void long before we were born, and will continue to do so even as we, like Moses, are swept up into His eternity. \n\tWhat are you afraid of today? And what uncertainties are causing these fears? Christianity says that these fears are both entirely understandable and entirely unnecessary. They are understandable in the sense that life is daunting: dogs will bite, waistlines will grow, and winter always comes. These things are all legitimate. But despite the fact that you will fear, you fear unnecessarily: 'Do not be afraid or terrified because of them!' Moses booms during his last moments on earth, 'God goes with you!' What ultimately and objectively matters in life is God’s word of promise in the face of your particular fears. This promise Jesus continues to echo to you today: 'I am with you always. I will never leave you nor forsake you.' \n\t—Dylan Potter"

		"text": "My great-grandfather died when he was 101 years old. He didn’t live to be quite as old as Moses, but had an impressive lifespan nonetheless; one marked by a healthy mind and body. During his 101st year, he bragged that an entire empire—the Soviet Union—had risen and fallen during his lifetime. Shortly before his death, my grandfather commented that he wished he could live for ten more years, to be there for my wedding and my ordination. He had a profound perspective and a lifetime of humble wisdom, and he shared with anyone who’d listen. When he died, my family experienced deep pain and uncertainty. What did the loss of our sage patriarch mean? Would anything be the same now that he was gone? What would happen to our family? \n\tThe last chapter of Deuteronomy is the end of an era, and what an era Moses has led: specially chosen to lead several thousand people out of slavery, he shows the triumph of God over the most powerful nation on earth. Moses gives God’s Law to the Jewish people. And while the era of Moses is marked by certain unpleasant realities, Moses oversees the most significant period of Jewish history, and his name becomes inseparable from Jewish identity and religion. \n\tIn today’s text, we read that Moses has died, which creates for Israel an uncertain future. What is to become of them? Will God still bless a nation that had so frequently rebelled against its leader? Does the end of Moses mean the end of God’s people? \n\tWe read, of course, that Israel neither fails nor fades after the death of Moses. In fact, his legacy helps to form and sustain God’s people for thousands of years to come. The story of Moses frames the future of his nation (and all nations) in two significant ways: First, Moses stands as Israel’s Law-giver. By reading further into the Israelites’ biblical history, the hand-delivered commandments do not necessarily perfect God’s people, but instead act as a kind of standard for their shortcomings (and, subsequently, the shortcomings of the entire human race). \n\tSecond, Moses leading God’s people out of Egyptian slavery is a legacy foreshadowing what Jesus Christ fulfills for all people on the cross. Jesus leads the fundamental exodus from the slavery of sin into the freedom of God’s grace. Moses, therefore, stands in history as both accuser and liberator. He provides for us a foretaste of God’s Law and Gospel—two great and constant themes of the Scriptures. \n\tThe end of Moses is not the end of God’s plan, nor the end of God’s dealings with His people. And Moses knew this: before his death, he foreshadows the coming Messiah, the one who would outshine his own ministry: 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen' (Deut. 17). Moses realizes that the center stage belongs to another, and that this One to come would bring salvation not only to Israel, but to the whole world. \n\tTimes of transition bring a great deal of uncertainty to our lives—we do not know what life will look like after a loss, a miscarriage, a new job, a new town. But we can rest assured that the same God who inspired Moses, and ultimately gave us His Son, is good. His providence always extends far beyond what we can now see. \n\t—Ethan Magness"

Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.",
		"text": "I have been taught much of my life that this passage’s intent, and others like it, is to provide motivation and encouragement for Bible memorization. Quite evidently, God tells Joshua that he shall be successful in all that he does by following the path of the Law: prosperity and success await all who 'do everything written in it.' \n\tBut is there more going on here? If someone were to read the entire account of Joshua’s life, it would quickly become clear that that neither he nor the people of Israel are careful to do everything written in the 'Book of the Law.' And, consequently, God’s promise to place Israel’s enemies beneath their feet is never completely carried out. What, then, is God saying in this passage? Why would He command Joshua to carry out a command we never see fulfilled?\n\tThe key to this quandary is in our interpretation. We assume that because God told Joshua not to let 'this Book of the Law depart from your mouth,' both he and we are capable of doing such a thing. It is logical to think that because God commands us to do something, we can do it. But real life experience shows that we fall short of this interpretation. Even the disciples, on the eve of Jesus’ arrest and crucifixion, can’t stay awake to wait and watch. I think, instead, God wants to communicate a much deeper truth to Joshua.\n\tGod repeatedly commands Joshua to be 'strong and courageous'—three times in this short passage. Right after telling Joshua that he can only be prosperous and successful by following the Law, it’s as if we see Joshua’s face become horror-stricken because God immediately says for the third time, 'Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.' God bolsters (rather than threatens) Joshua with these words because He, God, understands the gravity of His command, the weighty and incredible responsibility for Joshua filling Moses’ shoes. \n\tThe fact that God repeats His command of encouragement three times is significant—it’s like a crescendo, a swelling promise to Joshua that 'the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' God speaks relief into the wound revealed by the Law. God doesn’t say, 'So, yeah, stick to those rules and you should be good,' or 'Now get out there and make me proud!' God instead promises Joshua relationship above all else, in spite of Joshua’s achievement. God moves first—He comes down to Joshua because Joshua cannot meet Him. God’s promise in this passage points to His own fulfillment of the command. He answers His own requirements with a word of comfort. \n\t—Jeremy Coleman"

In addition, Rahab pleads for her family to be spared from death when the Israelites take the city. The spies agree and ask her to hang a scarlet cord from her window so that the Israelites will know to spare her household. \n\tIt’s an obscure story from the Old Testament, but it was near and dear to the heart of the martyred 16th century Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. He saw in this story an image of the unmerited love of God for those who might be considered the worst of sinners. Ashley Null writes that Cranmer \nintended his well-known reputation for giving grace to the unworthy to be a cardinal signal, a scarlet cord hung openly from the window of Canterbury, so that in the midst of the battles of his times and since, those with eyes to see should spot where the wall of the old order was first breached in England and recognize as comrades those in the household where the gospel conspiracy was first forged.\nThis scarlet cord has a double meaning—one to those who hang it from their window and another to those who see it. For Rahab it is an assurance of deliverance and protection. It is a reminder of the promise made to her and her family that they would be delivered from death. \n\tFor those who see the cord from the outside, it is much like the blood of the lamb smeared upon the doorposts at the first Passover (Ex. 12:1-14), a tangible sign of the non-negotiable mercy of God. No matter the character of the person within, God has covered those transgressions and held out His mercy. The blood makes the place a refuge, a place of safety to all who enter. \n\tWe, like Rahab, have been covered in the blood of the Lamb, Jesus Christ. Though we have no standing to escape the coming judgment, we know that God’s mercy is a seal of protection over us. And to those who see that scarlet cord know that in Him, there is infinite mercy, grace, and forgiveness for the sinner.\n\t—Andrew Pearson"

I had a pretty hard exterior, and this was completely intentional. \n\tI was just like Jericho; I needed a strong defense because on the inside I was weak, and weak was vulnerable. I built up walls to prevent any kind of infiltration: nothing got in, nothing got out. The fact of the matter was that I really just wanted to have someone infiltrate, but I wanted them to stick around after seeing what was on the inside of the wall.

I don’t drive a big pick-up anymore, and I am embarrassed by my old mantra, but I still have that old desire in my life to build up that wall. It may look a little different, but it’s really the same, and I think it’s a common tendency. \n\tIt’s certainly true of our relationship with God. For centuries humanity has developed intricate belief systems to defend ourselves against God’s invasive grace. We don’t believe that it is possible for Him to actually love us as we truly are. All we know is conditionality, and we’re often sure God is no different. Religion generally helps us here: we can maintain some notions of responsibility and control in relation to God, and we like that, because that way it’s up to us as to how much God is allowed in. If we are 'co-laborers with God,' we can forget that we are trapped in a game of self-preservation. How can we be free when we are too scared to actually face whom we really are?\n\tThankfully, God has 'given Jericho into your hand.' He breaks through your walls and claims you for His own.

You know the shtick: big walls, a seven-day parade around the walls, a few trumpet blasts, and the walls come 'a tumblin' down.' If you were in children’s Sunday school, though, this is where story-time would end, because the next few verses are actually pretty disturbing: the walls come down, and the Israelites proceed to destroy every living thing in Jericho—men, women, and children; even the animals are slaughtered and burned. These are the foul words of genocide more than the words of a children’s tale. \n\tThis entire section of Scripture, often called 'the Conquest of Canaan,' tells two stories. On a most basic level, it is the story of God giving the land He had promised Abraham. On a more literarily complex level, it is the foreshadowing of the judgment that we read about in the book of Revelation: when John writes Revelation, he uses the imagery of seven trumpet judgments so we’ll think back to this book and chapter. In both cases, nobody escapes. The virtuous are burned with the guilty. The beautiful along with the ugly. The old and young, male and female, all have come under God’s holy judgment. This is true in the land of Canaan, and this is true in the book of Revelation. And once God’s judgment is pronounced, there is no mercy or leniency for anybody.\n\t'But wait!', you quizzically interject, 'what about this Rahab person? Doesn’t Rahab and her family escape judgment?' And I am happy, of course, to concede this truth. But the fact that Rahab and her family are spared from God’s judgment proves difficult for us, doesn’t it? It completely turns our notions of justice and punishment upside down. Rahab is a prostitute. If anybody goes down, we expect her to be among the first to go. We read that her entire household was saved that day, and while we don’t know anybody in her household, we can surmise that none of them were particularly important people if they still associated with a prostitute. The people saved in this story are not saved because they are remarkable or saintly. They are saved even though they are unremarkable and sinful. This one family becomes, in turn, part of the people of God. As Hebrews 11 reminds us, it is by faith that Rahab fears God and the invading Israelites, and it is by that faith she is saved. \n\tFyodor Dostoevsky, the renowned Russian writer, picks up on this theme throughout Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov, the insane murdering protagonist, meets his alcoholic friend Marmeladov at a local bar. After discussing religion over drinks, some of the bar’s patrons ask the drunken Marmeladov if he thinks he will get into heaven. In drunken anger and frustration, he rises to the occasion and (ironically) preaches on this very subject. He and Rahab have a lot in common, and Marmeladov’s words powerfully echo the grace of God to his (and our) kind:\n'He will say, ‘come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!’ and we shall all come forth, without shame and stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, and made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come [into my kingdom] ye also!’ And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?’ And He will say, ‘this is why I receive them... that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out his hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep... and we shall understand all things...'\n—T.

My friend patiently reminded me that there’s no real difference between the 'Christian' and the 'non-Christian,' meaning that there’s not a different standard for the two, and there’s certainly not a sudden ability to perform, to do, or to be better once one is converted. The only difference is the cross. I thought that was ridiculous. Absurd.

The groom turns to his bride and says, 'I will love you and cherish you whenever it is convenient for me.' There is a pause and the bride smiles and, wiping a tear from her eye, says, 'And I will be faithful to you as long as I feel you deserve it, and I will care for and comfort you only when I am in a good mood.' \n\tNow there’s a realistic profession! Imagine that kind of honesty in any public ceremony. This is what happens at the end of the book of Joshua during the covenant renewal ceremony. Joshua asks the people of Israel to choose whether they will serve false gods and idols or if they will serve the Lord and his Law. The answer seems obvious, and it is for the Israelites, too. They tell Joshua that they 'will serve the Lord, for he is our God,' and Joshua then goes off script: 'You are not able to serve the Lord' (24:18-19).\n\tJoshua understands, correctly, that people are not able to do what they promise. Despite all the best intentions and desires, we will fail to live up to the standards we publicly or privately affirm and reaffirm. A brief look at the behavior of the Hebrews in the book of Judges proves that Joshua was completely right.\n\tWhether it is with God, your spouse, or your family, you—and everyone else—probably fail to consistently love and cherish people as you should. Rather than denying that we are unfaithful and inconsistent, we have another option: the good news is that when we are honest before God regarding our faithlessness, our merciful Savior forgives and restores us. We no longer need to make promises we cannot keep. And we no longer need to live under half-truths and dishonestly earnest desires. We can live instead in the rest of our faithful Lord. \n\t—Alex Large"

So the Lord sold them into the hands of Jabin... They cried to the Lord for help... Then the land had peace for forty years.",
		"text": "There is an unmistakable pattern present in these passages. The Israelites are quick to lose their trust in God. They abandon Him over and over again, only to then return in each instance (and in wake of the subsequent hardship that followed) with their spiritual tails between their legs. And He receives them each time without hesitation. \n\tIt’s a three-thousand-year-old problem, not unique to the Ancient Near East. We do it, too. We forget about God until times get tough. Then we pray again, seeking His guidance and clinging anew to the unfailing mercy of our loving heavenly Father. The hymn 'Come Thou Fount' describes this predicament famously: 'Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love.' Have you ever forgotten about God ('again')?\n\tJust as there was good news for the Israelites, there is good news for us. 'If we are faithless, he remains faithful' (2 Tim 2:13). God desires to help the sinner, not to punish.\n\tA powerful example of this dynamic comes from the 1980 film My Bodyguard. The story focuses on a high school student named Linderman. Linderman is a depressed teenage boy who exudes a reclusive, don’t-mess-with-me temperament. There are rumors that he once 'killed a kid' floating about the hallways of the school. The truth is that he witnessed the death of his younger brother and has come to blame himself for the incident. The film makes clear that Linderman is in full-scale shut-down mode, and he’s headed for trouble. \n\tBut one day, a new student named Carl (who himself is a bit of an outcast) befriends the reclusive Linderman. Carl invites him over to his house to meet his family, including Carl’s grandmother, the inimitable Ruth Gordon, with a warning: 'My grandmother is a little crazy.' \n\tWhen they enter the dining room, Ruth Gordon immediately gravitates toward the new guest. She insists on showing the boys a parlor trick, imposing upon Linderman to allow her to read his palm. She takes his open hand in hers, and after a minute points to a pronounced scar on the boy’s wrist: 'What’s this?' she asks. 'It’s nothing,' he responds, pulling his sleeve down and retracting his hand in a closed fist. \n\tBut Ruth Gordon persists. She grabs his fist back and opens his hand, saying, 'I’m not through with you yet, kid. Give me your hand; you’re among friends.' He relents. Then she looks down at his hand, and looks back at him, making eye contact. 'Let’s see... I see a long life... and good things... lots of good things.' The boy’s whole countenance suddenly does a 180, and it is the beginning of a hugely redemptive plot line. \n\tAnd so it is with the grace of God, even when the 'again' side of life creeps back in. 'Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you' (Matt 11:28). Or to quote Ruth Gordon: 'I’m not through with you yet, kid.'\n\t—John Zahl"

		"text": "'Little ones to Him belong, they are weak but He is strong.' Many have sung this line from the children’s song 'Jesus Loves Me,' and perhaps a few have even believed it. And yet, given the choice, who would ever choose his or her own weakness over strength? That is not the way of the world, nor is it the way of the self-oriented heart. Weakness is embarrassing; weakness is to be hidden away.\n\tWhen faced with a challenge, it makes so much more sense to marshal your resources, summon your strength, and put your best foot forward. In a world where we are taught to play to our strengths, who would choose the weak to do the job of the strong? \n\tGod would, apparently. After the strong and oppressive Midianites have 'overpowered Israel' for seven years, the Lord is on the move to save His people. As His instrument, He chooses Gideon, whose clan is the 'weakest in Manasseh.' And if that isn’t bad enough, the appointed deliverer is the 'least in [his] father’s house.' God deliberately chooses the least of the least.\n\tThere is only one reason to trust in this way of madness, this counter-intuitive preference for weakness over strength. And this is the reason God gives the bewildered Gideon: 'I will be with you.' God does not offer a detailed explanation of His rationale, nor does He outline a plan for how He intends to accomplish the task at hand. \n\tInstead, God simply offers Himself: 'I will be with you.' And it is enough. God is actually much, much more than enough, for He fills up our weakness with His strength. 'His power is made perfect in our weakness' (2 Cor 12:9). \n\t'I will be with you.' Simply put, it is our weakness that allows us to be with God. It is weakness that allows the little ones to belong to God. Little ones who know that though it is not the way of the world, God chooses what is foolish to shame the wise. And little ones like Gideon, whom the angel renames to be a 'mighty man of valor.'\n\t—Paul Walker"

God answers, 'In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her...' We find this message repeated over and over again in the Bible, that our strength is not very strong, and that at our most impressive, we are still not very impressive. But here in Judges the point is taken further. The problem lies not just in a miscalculation about the reliability of our own strength, but also it lies in the fact that assuming such a posture blocks out our need for God’s help. \n\tFrom God’s perspective, the prospect of having too much strength is a far more serious problem than not having enough of it. In fact, being weak is a crucial ingredient in true spirituality; it is actually one of life’s most important virtues. As it is said in the New Testament, 'The weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength' (1 Cor 1:25). \n\tDo you have any pressing weaknesses? We all do. Where are you stuck? Where do you need help? Today, you might try praying to God by reaching up from the point of impasse, your place of helplessness. It will not take many words. \n\t—John Zahl"

In my own case, this is the only lesson about Samson I remember from childhood. I couldn’t put the pieces together then, and I still cannot now. I always wondered if I’m supposed to be like Samson, does that mean I’m supposed to screw up? Because it sure seems to me that he makes a mess of his life. No one addressed that problem, so I left Samson’s story on the back shelf.\n\tSeveral years ago, as I was reflecting on this passage to prepare a sermon, it came to me anew: Samson demands that his father and mother give him what he wants, namely, a Philistine woman, even when it is perfectly clear that as a Nazarite he is not to be with a pagan, Gentile woman (14:1-3). Then, knowing full well that he shouldn’t touch dead things, Samson does it anyway. He scoops some honey out of a lion’s carcass and takes some to his parents. Hmmm... acting with rebellious motives, out of selfish pride... it sounds, well, uncomfortably familiar! In truth, I am Samson! I don’t need to try and be like him because I already am compelled and motivated by my own self-centered persuasions.\n\tWhenever I read this passage, it strikes me as a word of judgment. At the core of who I am as a human being, I am a sinner. I will do anything in order to get my way and make myself feel good. This passage leads me to first acknowledge my position among those who have made and continue to make a mess of their lives. And then it makes me want to say, 'Thank you, Lord, for Samson, because he not only shows me to myself, but he also shows me the depth of my need for the cross and the resurrection.' That depth just makes the grace of God all the more amazing. \n—Kyle Tomlin"

The memory is firm, because there were tears in my father’s eyes, as he was deeply moved by Ruth’s words to her mother-in-law, Naomi: 'for whither thou goest, I will go...' \n\tThese enduring words of love and commitment that so touched my father are uttered by an outcast. All of the power and passion of Ruth’s love for Naomi are set in the context of Ruth being an outcast in a hostile, alien land—and of her choosing to move into that land, in order to be with Naomi.\n\tWhat is your understanding of being an outcast? There are refugees in war torn lands. There are homeless folk on the streets of our prosperous nation—a recent survey noted that 150,000 Vietnam veterans are homeless in America, thirty-five years after that war. There are patients in hospitals and nursing homes who know that even with all the love in the world, you feel different and set apart when you’re sick, when you’ve got cancer, when you use a walker, when you’ve contracted Alzheimer’s.\n\tSome of us have tasted outcast experience when we’ve been out of work, when our marriages have failed, or when our bodies haven’t measured up to standards set by Jane Fonda workouts and Lance Armstrong posters. And even for those of us who show no outward hint of being an outcast—even for those of us with a secure home and a loving spouse and a good job—even then, there comes that 3 A.M. moment when the dreams are still unfulfilled and the pressure to 'make it' mounts—that secret, solitary moment when being an outcast defines us all.\n\tI asked a friend about when he feels like an outcast, and he said, 'The question is, when don’t I?'\n\tWe are children of Ruth. We are heirs of this woman for all seasons—and this is good news. Because Ruth marries a terrific fellow named Boaz. They have a son named Obed. Obed has a son named Jesse. And Jesse has a son named David—King David, whom God calls, 'A man after my own heart.' (Acts 13:22)\n\tBut that’s not all. David also has a son, and his son has a son, and on and on, until generations later, in the same little town of Bethlehem where Ruth had married Boaz, another child in the house and lineage of David is born—a child whose ancestor is an outcast.\n\tIt’s the heart of the Gospel—that God took on flesh and chose to be an outcast, chose to take on His shoulders all the pain and the consequences of our 3 A.M. moments, so that we may hear Him say to us, 'Welcome home.'\n\t—Jim Munroe"

'Associate yourself with those who will help you advance.' 'Make allies of the strong and you will be strong.' But the singer of the Jimmy Cox song is not strong. He isn’t of any use to anyone. He used to be, but he isn’t anymore: any associations now offer no advantage.\n\tIt is much the same with Naomi—she’s certainly down and out. Widowed with dead sons, left alone with her daughters-in-law: it is far more than loneliness that awaits these Naomi and what’s left of her family. Naomi is no longer of any use to her two daughters-in-law. She has no husband to provide for them and no sons to protect them. If you wanted to make allies with the strong, you would stay far away from Naomi.\n\n\tA very interesting and unexpected thing takes place, though. While Orpah leaves her mother-in-law to pursue better prospects (and, honestly, who can blame her?), Ruth clings to her. In the original language it is exactly the same word used to describe a husband clinging to his wife in Genesis 2: 'and they will be one flesh.' Ruth becomes as one with Naomi as she suffers. In her love for her mother-in-law, Ruth makes Naomi’s fate her own.\n\tThis would just be a nice and inspiring story if it were self-contained, but it is not. If you go to the first chapter of Matthew, you will see the only mention of Ruth in the New Testament. It is in the genealogy of our Lord, Jesus Christ. The woman who forsakes her own prerogatives in order to fasten herself to a tragic widow gives us a glimpse into who Jesus is. It helps us understand that in his life as 'a man of sorrows' and his death on a cross, he fastens himself to us in our suffering so that we also share in the hope of his resurrection.\n\t—David Browder"

This happens a lot: it could be finding the right job, the right spouse, the time to get it all accomplished. It could also be interior, like wanting to get over your self-esteem problems, like wanting to stop sounding so depressed all the time. We feel so uncomfortable with the helplessness, mostly because we think there might be some karmic payoff for our good intentions. In Hannah’s case, she just wants to have a child. \n\tTo make matters worse for us, we humans aren’t too good at helping each other out, either. It’s not that we necessarily want to ostracize other sufferers; it’s more that we, sometimes unwittingly, do whatever we can to minimize the reminders of our own suffering. We can make fun of it, offer a 'fix it,' suggest steps to self-improvement—anything but sit helplessly together. Ultimately, perhaps it is a faithless fear that if we can’t control the circumstances, then there is no help anywhere. It is a fear that God can’t or won’t act. In the yawning gap between where we are and where we want to be, we often do not think that God could potentially be able to work—and even work especially—through that place of helplessness.\n\tUsually we hide these feelings because they seem unseemly, needy, or weak. Like Hannah, we can repress these feelings for a long, long time, but they always seem to find their way out. \n\tLike many of us, Hannah has been hiding these feelings until they finally find their release at the altar, and it seems that her comfort does not come until this admission that she is anxious and vexed. It is as if God’s presence persistently provokes her to the point of honesty, and at least to me, this seems to be how we always come to Him. He always moves first.\n\tEli mentions the 'God of Israel' as if to say this is the God of history. God has always and will always be this way; He knows each one of our particular places of hidden woe and meets us there with the kind of forgiveness that Jesus died to give. Notice how Hannah leaves in peace, 'her face no longer sad,' her appetite returned. Moments in our life like this one remind us of our helpless state, and isn’t it encouraging to know that God—throughout history—meets us there?

Yet over and over again, the Bible declares that God is present—and actually active—in suffering and death, from the plagues poured out on the Egyptians, to the many exiles of Israel, to the cross of Christ, and beyond.\n\tAs we encounter suffering in our own lives, perhaps the best question to ask is not 'How could God let this happen?', but 'How could God not?' That is to say, would we rather believe in a God who is present and active in our sufferings, or absent and powerless? Furthermore, if God is absent in our sufferings, where exactly is He? What portion of our life could we honestly say is without difficulty? If we excuse or exclude God from our pain, we practically cut him out of our lives altogether.\n\tKilling is part of God’s work, but it is not the end, for on the other side of every death, every suffering, both great and small, is resurrection.

However, one of the most powerful forms of grace is when a parent releases that control and allows their son or daughter to make a mistake—or two or three—in unconditional love.\n\tWhen we talk about my college years now, my father tells me that he has no idea what he was doing or how he managed to survive that time himself. The bottom fell out when I arrived home for winter break sophomore year: I had done miserably in my classes; I was worn out and thoroughly depressed. I told my father that I had had enough of college and planned to drop out. \n\tMy father was hurt, and also concerned about the education I was giving up. Of course, he wanted to fix everything, but instead he just asked me, 'Are you sure?' When I said yes, he let the matter drop. We talked about other things over winter break—my part-time job, politics, the Patriots—anything except dropping out. However, a few days before the semester was to begin, I strangely felt capable of returning. I didn’t know why. \n\tIt took me years to understand that moment: that the space allowed for mistakes—and love despite them—is utterly and beautifully superhuman. This space is a total game-changer when it touches you. In the passage above, God acquiesces to the Israelites’ request for a king, so that they can 'go to college' with the other nations. He lets them make the mistake, even though it not only means rejecting Him, but also more mistakes. However, what we see is that God’s love never abandons us, even when we abandon Him. His love is always there: it is always bigger than the mistakes we make, and nothing—not even our own foolish desires and decisions—can ever separate us from it. \n\t—Leonard Finn"

This is perfect love, the kind that drives out fear (1 John 4:18). \n\tThough you have everything to fear as you stand before God’s judgment, you also have nothing to fear—because there is no fear in love. God’s love compels Him to forget judgment in order to make you His own. As you stand before the righteous God, He will see every part of you, and in spite of it all, He will not forsake you.

The message of the Gospel is that victory has been won. The battle was one-on-one, winner-take-all, and the outcome has been decided. It is with this confidence that St. Paul writes, 'Death has been swallowed up in victory. The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God!

		"text": "Try saying 'Mephibosheth' five times in row—it’s a mouthful! But it’s also a name that should conjure up only the most positive associations. To set the scene: After David becomes king of Israel (following Saul’s defeat and suicide), his first order of business is to find any surviving relations of his late, beloved friend Jonathan, Saul’s son, so that he might show them kindness. \n\tDavid soon finds out that Jonathan’s sole living heir, Mephibosheth, is 'crippled in both feet' and not exactly regal material. Mephibosheth seems to have internalized his disabilities, referring to himself in front of David as 'a dead dog' (9:8). Yet without any hesitation, David restores to him all of his family land and issues the command that Mephibosheth is to dine at the king’s table at every meal, henceforth. \n\tThis is a touching example of grace in the Old Testament. An unworthy person receives love and favor on account of something that someone else has done. Even more, there is a deep security to the new situation—Mephibosheth will always eat at David’s table, like one of his sons. What is the result of this radical decree? We are told that Mephibosheth himself has a son. That is, hope springs where there was once desperation and life where there once was death. (Of course, the feet remain crippled...)\n\tSometimes we get to witness grace like this, and occasionally we even get to experience it. Even though acts of grace astound us, it is only a shadow of the real thing: the grace given by God on account of the death of Jesus. \n\tHave you ever felt like a dead dog? Or perhaps there is something in your life that feels (or looks) like a dead dog? That’s where the voice of the King is to be heard, the voice of unconditional love that makes dead things alive and brings hope to the hopeless.

Work, play, shopping, television, relationships, hobbies, philosophies—anything can be used to manipulate the reality of things gone wrong. It would not be too far to say that Christianity itself has often been used as a tool of reality-rejection.\n\tPeople often have a sober view of themselves around the time of their conversion. They are confronted with the reality of their need for help, and like Saul on the road to Damascus, they fall off their horse and cry out for mercy from the Lord. This sobriety, however, proves fleeting. Old habits die hard, and we return to striving against reality faster than you can say pickle. Almost as soon as we become Christians, we start the business of working Jesus out of a job. \n\tConsider David. We often look at him as an example of humility and dependence upon God. He suffered greatly while being persecuted under King Saul, and he was keenly aware of his need for God’s grace. But when Nathan comes to him, he is now the king of Israel, the chosen one of God, the 'man after God’s own heart.' Nathan comes to him and tells him a story of betrayal, deceit, and murder and asks David to judge the fate of the perpetrator in the tale. An amazing thing happens: David is so disconnected from himself that he promptly and indignantly dispenses a harsh judgment upon the guy in Nathan’s story. Then the anvil falls. David has taken the bait, as it were, and Nathan delivers the crushing reality to which David is blind: 'You are the man!'\n\tThere is no wiggle room here. There is no compromise due to his kingship. There is simply the pointing of the finger; the definitive, indisputable reality that David is the guilty man. This 'man after God’s own heart' is the adulterer, murderer, betrayer, liar, and denier. (Aside: Isn’t it interesting that often, like David, the qualities you react to most harshly in someone else are also true of you?)\n\tWe are just like David. We are okay with the fact that we are the guilty ones until we are the chosen ones, but no one wants to face the fact that we continue to be the guilty ones afterward. In becoming Christians we often think our deceit and pride have (or should have) been arrested. But just like David, our denial cannot last. No matter how hard we resist it, we will always be brought face-to-face with the mirror. God’s Law, which demands absolute perfection, will always catch up to us.

And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, 'Arise and eat.' And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, 'Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.'",

He wants to die; he is overcome by guilt and the legacy of his past; he wants to believe this is the end of his great and noble prophetic mission. He is doing his very best to have a Thelma & Louise moment. \n\tGod has compassion on Elijah anyways, despite the melodrama: 'The journey is too great for you.' But instead of reminding him of his mighty task, or of the limitlessness of divine mercy, or of the importance of life and the beauty of Creation, God just gives him cake. And lets him sleep. And then gives him cake again.\n\tGod knows what we need far better than we do, and often our true needs are embarrassingly mundane. It is humiliating to hear that sometimes, when we think we are wrestling with angels, we are mainly just tired and hungry, or that the sensation of drowning in oceans of guilt is mostly just a hangover. The worst attack of anxiety we can experience is, in the end, mainly the product of a couple of temporary chemical reactions in the chest and stomach. \n\tAt the end of John’s Gospel, Jesus meets with Simon Peter, absolves him of guilt for his three denials, sets his life task ahead of him, and predicts his painful death.

How does this happen?\n\tElijah has boldly challenged Israel’s unbelief by proposing a duel, a test of powers between the false gods they are worshiping and the true God of Israel. God answers this prayer, triumphantly bringing down fire from heaven on Elijah’s sacrifice before all of Israel, proving that He alone is God. \n\tRather than admitting Elijah’s success and God’s supremacy, Jezebel, the queen of Israel, threatens to kill Elijah. After a great victory, Elijah is running for his life again, now so sick and tired of it all that he sits under a tree and just prays to die. God answers his prayer by feeding him. Frustrated, Elijah presses on and finally finds a cave to crawl into. When God asks him what he’s doing there, Elijah vents his disappointment, saying that despite his zeal, despite his faithfulness to the Lord, the Israelites have 'forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword' (19:14). Elijah had prayed, and fire had come down from heaven—what’s it going to take to change people’s hearts? \n\tGod responds by dismantling Elijah’s expectations. He tells Elijah to stand because he’s about to pass by. The spectacle starts big and gets bigger. A terrible wind passes, an earthquake rumbles and fire comes down from heaven, but God is in none of these. Finally, 'a sound of sheer silence' causes Elijah to cover his face with his mantle. \n\tThis reminds us, as God says, that it is 'not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,' that it is always God’s faithfulness that turns hearts to Him, in the quietness of God’s time. And God’s time often works against our expectations. Signs and wonders, faithfulness, miracles, community, social justice, discipleship are all good things, but they are not the mark of Christianity. The mark of Christianity is the faithful love of God, the good news that Jesus died in our place and, by his Spirit, helps us believe. \n\t—Dusty Brown"

To be like a child is not to put your head in the sand or to be naïve about the world. It is rather to remember, once more, that with God all things are possible (Matt 19:26). At home, at work, or with family, it is freedom to love again instead of just manipulating those we once loved.\n\tTo be like a little child is also to be relieved of the illusion of self-sufficiency and control. One of the great abiding images of our relationship to God is the helplessness of the crying, struggling newborn, full of need and utterly powerless to do anything about it. Babies are some of the most purely self-absorbed creatures on the planet, but at least they have no illusion of autonomy.

And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, 'How can I bring the ark of God home to me?'",
		"text": "I remember hearing this passage when I was a child and thinking it was the most unfair in the Bible. Why on earth would God do such a thing to someone, especially someone trying to help? Poor Uzzah! Shouldn’t he be rewarded for trying to prevent the Ark of the Covenant from falling to the ground? Doesn’t God, shouldn’t God appreciate good intentions?\n\tIt seems Scripture is clear here that humans cannot control God’s terms for how we relate to Him—even when it seems like He needs our intervention. This not only includes salvation, but also the way we live our lives. In other words, our lives before God are not established by the plans we make, but by the plans that God has made. \n\tIn the Old Testament, God’s Law requires people to carry the Ark of the Covenant with wooden poles attached through rings (Ex 25). In this passage, though, the Ark is not carried by people, but pulled by oxen on a cart. Still, we think, Big deal, why smite a man because of that?\n\tWhat was his offense? Though King David is the one calling the shots, Uzzah does not revere God’s holiness. What would have happened had Uzzah allowed the Ark to fall into the dirt, truthfully is... nothing. It was worse for an unclean human hand to touch the Ark, the symbol of God’s holiness, than for dirt to touch the Ark. How archaic, you might think—people, more unclean than dirt?\n\tDirt never determines right from wrong on its own terms. This passage is a stinging reminder that even in the face of God’s blessing—for David wins the day and brings the Ark into the new capital—we are still sinners before a holy God. We cannot help God out. We are unfit to handle His business.\n\tThis is also a warning against thinking that our own efforts, even with the best intentions, are righteous to God. God’s holiness quickly strips us of that pretension; our best is simply not enough. We need something better than our best: we need God’s mercy. What Uzzah needs, and what you and I need, is not our best intentions under God’s Law, but God’s grace in our failings.\n\t—Ben Phillips"

It can seem fleeting, like a trick of the light, but when the Spirit is unleashed, the Almighty Himself is involved. \n\tIn this passage, the whole of Judah has fallen prey to a fit of powerlessness. 'Our eyes are on you.' The consequence is their salvation—and the decimation of the opposing army: 'they looked toward the horde, and behold, there were dead bodies lying on the ground; none had escaped' (20:24).\n\tSometimes, of course, the revelation is that the 'great horde coming against us' is none other than God Himself. The thing we are trying to avoid turns out to be our own salvation rising to meet us. For these reasons, prayers of this sort may seem dangerous.

Trusting in your own basic goodness—at least in comparison to others—allows you to think that all is right with God. It allows you to think of yourself as an upright citizen. \n\tBut enter your 'secret sins and misdeeds dark' into the equation and everyone is on equal footing. Actually, according to the Law of God, everyone has lost his or her footing completely. Given the subliminal lives we lead, we are forced to conclude with Ezra: 'for none can stand before you because of this.'

I have found little consolation, however, in merely wallowing in my crises. If I insist upon trying to satisfy myself by drinking exclusively from the trough of my own predicament, I taste nothing but the bitter tones of wormwood. The good news is that God is simultaneously speaking two words to you and me—Law and Gospel—and one is louder than the other. It is the louder word of the Gospel, His love in the presence of my grief, which never fails to pull me from the trough again. \n\tThe people in Nehemiah’s day have just returned to Jerusalem from their captivity in Babylon. What they come back to is a pale remnant of its former glory: all that remains is a crumbling city wall, with no temple to speak of. \n\tThe Israelites are to blame for the calamity: they were the ones who had turned on God, and as a result God sent them into captivity for 70 years. It seems to me that God is good to serve these pints of sorrow, but that this serving is never meant to be the last call. He is too wise a bartender to withhold the sweet cordial. \n\tThe narrator tells us that Nehemiah has gathered the people together after the wall had been built and a new, smaller temple was standing once again. Just then, the Levites begin to read the Law to the people, and the Israelites fall apart. The entire community begins to weep tears of contrition, the memories of what had been and what could have been becoming too much to bear.\n\tThis seems natural. It may even seem like what God desires from us even after we have repented. I recall times in my life when I felt the need to confess the same sin over and over again. This compulsion seemed right to me until I heard my pastor preach one Sunday about God’s abundant forgiveness and goodness in Christ, which is essentially what Nehemiah says once he sees Israel reaching for the bottle of wormwood: 'Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet,' he implores them, 'for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.'\n\tYou do not have the ability to grieve over all of your sins all the time. You do not even know them all! As the Israelites demonstrate, there is a time for our grief, but those of us who stand in the shadow of Christ’s cross are invited into the Lord’s joy as well. We read about the congregation’s response to Nehemiah’s gracious message later, that 'all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them' (8:12).

We are often silent or inarticulate with Him, pridefully nervous about praying the wrong thing or too faithless to think prayer worthwhile. Yet the Bible insists that God delights in meager voices. From Genesis to Revelation, and in the whole history of the Church, the voices of God’s people resound with this hope, perhaps the most basic of them all: God hears you.\n\tIn this passage from the most tortured sufferer we know, Job, we hear the true voice of prayer. It is not one that speaks the right words. It is not one that spends time trying to 'create space' for God, to 'posture your attitude' before God. Job yells at God, completely freaks out at Him. His tears can’t find their end. It’s a Robert Duvall kind of prayer in The Apostle, the kind that wakes the neighbors at night. Job cannot silence his affliction—he has no idea why God was allowing these horrible things to happen in his life—so he clings to the hope that God hears him. In the innermost recesses of all of his bereavement, Job cannot help but continue depending on the one certitude he has left—that God, at the very least, hears him. \n\tMy life would not look the same without this assurance. After college I decided that I wanted to do ministry, and I was dating a girl overseas. Distance was hurting the relationship, and my dad was not particularly thrilled about my career choice. Thankfully, I was accepted into a ministry training program in a church in London, but the visa process was taking way too long, and my girlfriend couldn’t find a job in London. I tried to pray, but kept feeling like God was completely absent from the entire situation. Towards the end of August I was just praying out of sheer desperation and was practically cursing at God, and soon after my visa fell through. \n\tBack to square one, out of the blue, my father offered to pay for a Master of Theology degree in England. I was floored by the generosity and support, and it seemed like everything was working out. I got to England, however, and my girlfriend and I couldn’t stop fighting. Again, angry prayers were dispatched, this time from my dorm room in England. The answer came the next Sunday when my girlfriend began crying and couldn’t stop because she felt so unhappy. The breakup made it seem as if everything that had passed was futile—all that effort for nothing. \n\tWhen I think about that time in my life, which was actually quite recently, I can remember most vividly my time spent in prayer. I didn’t know what God was doing, but it looked like He was doing the opposite of what I thought He should be doing. I still don’t understand why. But I grew closer to God because I learned even more that God hears me. \n\tIt is this promise that brings us to 'bend the knees of our hearts,' as the French Reformer Guillaume Farel once put it. God hears us. Although we don’t understand so much of our lives, let us be bold to lift up our hearts, for God is good and hears our prayer. \n\t—Javier Garcia"

They respond to Job’s lament with words that they hope will help Job, that will comfort him by making some sense of what has happened.\n\tAre they helpful? Do they have wisdom and understanding? As we read later in the book, much—but not all—of what they say does ring true. But how does Job receive their words?\n\tTwo thoughts come to mind: First, Job is not helped by their words. Again and again, he complains of their wordy responses, sort of like Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady: 'Words, words, words. All I hear is words!' He begs his friends to be silent. He calls them 'worthless physicians' and tells them that 'to keep silent would be wise' (13:5). That is to say, there is nothing we can say in the face of suffering that is going to be helpful. To be silent, to be present but silent, is the wise response rather than any attempt to comfort or explain with words.\n\tSecondly, I wonder whether Jobʼs time of suffering might not have been shortened, had his friends remained quiet. Why? Because Job ultimately has to deal with God Himself, directly, regarding His injustice. This is only speculation, but do not his well-intentioned friends actually prolong his suffering and postpone his coming to peace with God with their wordy explanations? Would their continued silence have given Job the space in which to hear his own voice and listen to Godʼs? One thing is for sure: Job did not receive his friendsʼ words as either helpful or comforting.\n\t'Oh, that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom.'\n\t—Mary Zahl"

And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me!

		"text": "I recently was at a bookstore (one of the big ones that begins with a 'B') looking to rid myself of a gift card that was burning a hole in my pocket. Most trips to any bookstore for me involve a quick stroll through the 'Christian Inspiration' section, and interestingly enough, I routinely find that almost all the books there have the same motifs of self-improvement or new techniques for spiritual disciplines. I think the idea of self-improvement is what really inspires us these days. \n\tThe God of the Book of Job doesn’t seem to inspire Americans these days. After all, if self-discovery and happiness are the 'alpha and omega' of our existence, how on earth could the themes of failure, judgment, and authority possibly make waves? \n\tThis is greatest problem about a lot of the books I see in these shelves: a person’s greatest need is not to be inspired, but to experience grace. The fundamental view of people as OK, and maybe just needing a little inspiration, falls short of the reality of lost people in dire need of intervention. \n\tNow enter the Book of Job.\n\tThere’s no doubt about it; Job is a tough book. It’s a really long journey into one man’s misery, but few other scriptural books fly in the face of 'Christian Inspiration' like Job. After being cosmically dumped, Job is visited by three friends trying to pry out the reason for his suffering. His friends think, much like we do today, that because we are generally OK people, doing good brings health and wealth, and doing wrong brings plagues and famines. \n\tNo matter how common it is, life based on this kind of performance-ism eventually falls either into denial of our weaknesses or denial of God. People burdened under this law of karma find themselves buying inspirational books or burned out with church, tired of their lives not changing. These burnouts usually happen when tragedy strikes. \n\tThe passage in Job today works against our inspiration-minded, performance-based persuasions. In verse 29 Job reminds himself that he is a sinner—unable to control of please God with obedience. If a person could do such a thing, then Job would not be in the mess he’s in. But there is hope, not in our fulfillment of God’s Law, as good as it is, but in God’s grace. Hope that God will be a redeemer of sinners (19:25), that He will resurrect dead sinners to new life, both in body and spirit (19:26). \n\tThis is the promise of resurrection in Jesus Christ, that he is the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25), and those who believe in him will be raised up with him (John 6:40). On that day, when God’s saving work is finished, we are promised, 'yet in our flesh we shall see God.' \n\t—Ben Phillips"

		"text": "This line is repeated throughout the entire Bible: 'Salvation belongs to the Lord.' In the Old Testament, God is always saving His people from encroaching danger—there are stories about it, songs about it in Psalms, and prophecies of it in books from Isaiah to Malachi. Later, when the angel comes to Mary in the New Testament, he says, 'Name him Jesus, because he will save his people.' During his ministry Jesus says, 'I have come to seek and save the lost.' When the Bible talks about salvation, it is proclaiming the central concept of the Christian faith and Scriptures.\n\tYou may have been asked before by someone, 'Are you saved?' It is a great question, but what does it mean? Saved from what? We say, 'saved from our sins,' but why? \n\tThe Christian belief is that we are saved from God by God. This sounds odd at first hearing, and we may even protest. Often times we prefer to 'bail God out of actually being God.' We are more or less comfortable with a God who saves, but we don’t often like to think of God as Judge. But in order to be the saving God, God must also be a judging God. If He is sovereign enough to save His people, God must have sovereignty not to. It cannot be me, or the devil, or the world; it is His call either to leave us condemned and dead, or to raise us to life. \n\tSalvation belongs to the Lord. In other words, as Dr. Mark Mattes, theology professor at Grandview College, has said, 'God is so for you as your defender that he is against himself as your accuser.' This is the message of the cross, God saving you from God’s wrath by diverting it onto Jesus. You are saved from God’s wrath by God’s mercy.\n\t—Justin Holcomb"

Whether it comes in the form of open-mindedness towards race, criminal history, gender, religious belief or sexual orientation, we operate under the expectations to accept our neighbor as our equal or become the black sheep ourselves. \tIn order to accomplish this, we’re asked to dig deep within ourselves and learn to tolerate each other’s differences so that we may live together harmoniously. Not only does this commandment create yet another mindset for us to rebel against; it merely accomplishes a facade of tolerance towards those around us and does little to move our hearts towards truly loving one another. \n\tI met a homeless man a few months ago with a history of unspeakable offenses and addictions that he still struggles with to this day. Our friendship began under the framework of my feeble attempt to 'dutifully' love my neighbor, but thankfully developed into something much more sincere. At the same time of our encounter, I happened to be reading through Martin Luther’s Bondage of the Will and had thus been thinking of our inabilities to will ourselves away from evil towards good. This was remarkable. In the context of my newly forged friendship, the darkness of the human condition proved to be mankind’s only true source of equality. This man, at first glance appearing to be from an entirely different level of despair, was no more or less broken than myself. \n\tNo more deserving of the grace of God, no more capable of fulfilling what the law requires, my friend and I have been forgiven just the same. I no longer viewed him as someone I should merely tolerate, but rather a brother I could love. The beauty of the Gospel is that it shows us to be the moral equivalent of everyone other than Christ, which enables genuine friendships and true love for our neighbor. We are all equally fallen and equally forgiven. \n\t—Josh Bascom"

This, apparently, is how the psalmist sees this valley, where the great enemy Death makes its home. It is a place where the psalmist can confidently 'fear no evil' surprising him from the shadows; where those immovable, shadow-casting mountains are no longer seen as a challenge to be scaled.\n\tHow is this possible, though? What is this secret formula that equals no fear? The psalmist answers, 'Because thou art with me.' I am not alone. In fact, the good shepherd, the one who provides all I need (23:1-3), is the one who is not just guiding me, but is as close as the air I breathe. Nothing can separate me from Him, not even Death itself. He is my friend, my companion, my guide. He does not condemn me for my fear. Instead of merely cheering me from the mountain, He comes alongside me to help, to protect me and give me someone to lean on.\n\tThe German theologian Jürgen Moltmann wrote years ago that what we see in Jesus could be summarized as, 'God is for us and God is with us.' This is the expressed message of Psalm 23.\n\tAs I meditate on this verse, I think: Yes, I am in a valley right now. This place is dark, and full of dread. Thank you, Lord, that I can acknowledge I am in a valley. I cannot see whatever might be around the corner in the shadows. My imagination is starting to run wild—but thou art with me. I am not alone. \n\tThere are mountains in my life, huge situations or relationships that do not change. They often make my life seem truly dark. Sure, some of these may just be projections of my imagination, but they are real to me and they make me edgy, anxious, guarded. They loom—I cannot get any distance on them in this valley. But, thou art with me. You do not condemn me for my anxiety. You will not leave me to find the way through these mountains. You know the way, and together we will keep walking.\n\t—Mary Zahl"

As opposed to our sparse moments in the limelight, it is when the chips are down and hope is dim that the Gospel actually makes the most sense. When you are struggling with regret or the scars of life’s disappointments, absolutely nothing but the Gospel will speak to you. Looking to ourselves for resolve can only add to the unease and worry. Will we ever do enough, we ask? \n\tFrom this place of suffering, David knows he cannot, and he cries out to God for just this kind of mercy. He bases that request for mercy not upon his actions or his inherent goodness, but rather upon the goodness of the Lord. The great King David specifically asks God not to look at his past or present.\n\tWe are able to cry out to God no matter what, not because we have built up enough credit with God, but because God regards us as if we were each His own beloved Son.

It turns up regularly in the Old Testament, particularly in the Psalms, but it is not just an Old Testament concept; rather, it points to this love’s fulfillment in the gift of God’s Son.\n\tThrough Jesus, God has and is actively reaching into our chaos, our sin, our pain, and our confusion. God initiates this relationship, and when we are grasped through His hesed, we are secure, not driven away or lost. This great love has the strange capacity to lift up and bring to new life.

This vengeance takes different forms but I, for one, have perfected the grudge. I withhold forgiveness until there’s groveling, and then I acquiesce, just so long as the offender shows enough remorse not to repeat the transgression. Passive aggression is key: cold shoulder, silent treatment, condescending eyes. When you finally relent, you store the episode for future reference; a type of collateral, if you will. You don’t even have to say it, but the other person knows you have a storehouse of past faults to keep them in your hand—it’s the only way to win. \n\tSurely enough, family life is where retribution explodes. This summer I have been crashing at my parents’ apartment in New York City. Almost every day a new grudge match surfaces. It has been exhausting, but not nearly as exhausting as if we actually forgave one another. If we forgave one another, which is out of the question, we would have to continue forgiving each other, because it would never stop, and I know they’d take my forgiveness as license to keep getting under my skin! And God forbid me actually receiving their forgiveness...\n\tThere is an old joke that a man, after getting drunk on vodka and tonic, rum and tonic, and gin and tonic, figures it all out and says, 'It must be the tonic!' I’ve come to think this is a description of our stance towards forgiveness. \n\tBehind the evasion tactics and blame shifting; behind the ploys at self-justification and self-promoting; behind all of it, there is a poor sufferer that thirsts for respite. This respite can only be found in the nonsensical forgiveness of God. It is the alien work of the cross, the only solution to our pluses and minuses within the merit-demerit system. For both the occasional colossal mistakes and the routinely subconscious ones, cosmic forgiveness is the only escape. \n\tThis passage tells us of the unconditional promise that God’s forgiveness is assured beyond measure. According to the psalmist, God’s forgiveness surrounds us. There are no gaps to this assurance; God doesn’t play games with us and doesn’t hold grudges or toy with our standing—God’s favor does not fluctuate like ours. \n\tWhen we dwell on this steadfast love of God and how it surrounds us, gratitude swells naturally within us.

The record is as close to perfection as pop music can get: a powerful lyric married to an irresistible melody, delivered with feeling in just under three minutes. Pure Motown gold.\n\tThe song captures something powerful in its vivid description of brokenheartedness: 'I walk in shadows, searching for light, cold and alone, no comfort in sight, hoping and praying for someone to care, always moving and going nowhere'.

The death of a loved one, the disappointment of a dream, even the wrong candidate winning an election—and the list goes on. \n\tSadly, heartbreaking experiences tend to be definitive.

I tend to think that my problems are bigger than anything else, the biggest of all time. \n\tBack when I was a classroom teacher, there were these moments in staff meetings at work when this became glaringly clear, glaringly sad, and somehow comforting, because I could see this tendency of mine play itself out in just about everyone else around the room. During these meetings, we were supposed to go around and share our opinions on a new policy. Looking around the room at that point was really interesting—no one would actually listen to the speaker, and everyone would be planning what they were going to say. It was sad, but also kind of funny: everyone would gush out these well-phrased opinions, nervously skirting the judgment of their audience, and there really was no audience.

I exhaust myself thinking about myself. The psalmist here seems to know the feeling: he is actually begging to be saved from it, in the knowledge of his own finitude. Somehow, if he knows that he and his problems are 'fleeting,' he can have rest. Why is this? Is it because he can then understand that he was being ridiculous after all, making his molehill a mountain, and can then attack the problem and rise victorious? No, he’s not saying this.

But there is something else going on—a factor rarely discussed by the American Medical Association, but ever-present throughout Scripture: sin.\n\tBy sin, we don’t mean, 'I lied and cheated, therefore I am depressed.' (Although it is true that sin does create 'turmoil' in one’s soul.) By sin we mean that because of the Fall, our hearts are wired to see life in terms of production, followed inevitably by the awful judgment of that production. By sin, we mean the terrible human burden of wondering whether we’re any good or not. By rejecting the judgment-free life of the Garden of Eden, we have all reaped the Sinner’s Reward.\n\tThe psalmist wrestles with God as he wrestles with his own soul. The outward factors that attend his despair, the multiple causes that create the 'tears that have been (his) food day and night' (42:3), may or may not be similar to the disparate demons and devils that cast a pall over our lives. But we can be sure that the root of the psalmist’s 'deadly wound' is the root of all our deadly wounds: the sin that says I must earn my way in order to be accepted and happy and satisfied.\n\tAnd there is only one place of help for this fundamental 'oppression of the enemy.' The psalmist says it concisely: 'Hope in God.' For God has given us His Son who has loved us in our sin. Jesus took the deadly wound of judgment on himself so that we could be delivered into the judgment-free world of grace. We have been given the reward of Life that Jesus earned for our sake. \n\tTo hope in God is to know that the categories of 'any good or not' no longer apply to those who trust in Jesus’ goodness. 'Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.'\n\t—Paul Walker"

There is darkness all around and profoundly honest confession. Death.\n\tI had a friend say to me the other day that he used to pray for clarity and direction, but now his life feels so out of control that it’s become a simple 'save me.' This is the thing of which we’re most afraid. The car has crashed. The divorce paper is signed. The child is lost. The depression has kept us in bed. It might be happening to us, be true about us; it’s what we can’t stop, try as we might. It is defeat.\n\tIt’s the dark place. It’s where we could not be more scared, more angry, more despairing, more unattractive, more selfish. Many of us live with this every day in some way, and sometimes it all comes crashing in.\n\tThe psalm says that God is at the bottom with us, speaking to this deep, dark, repressed place. Shockingly, He uses whatever thing it happens to be today to address us there. That is how we are first introduced to Him—in some area of our failure and His unending forgiveness. Despite however good a day we might be having, we come to Him no other way but at the bottom of the cross, under the waterfall of blood Jesus shed for us. I actually need Jesus; I need his grace. Christ has stirred whatever wave has crashed over me, and he is the one able to pull me up and give me breath. His deep love calls to my deep pain.\n\tIn fact, even as I write this, I feel so low and uncertain about the future that I doubt these very words of faith and comfort. May He prove true.\n\t—Kate Norris"

		"text": "The psalmist brings two things to bear here:\n\tFirst, it is okay to ask God for joy. Joy is good. The reality of sin and of human limitations, and the truth of the cost of atonement, are no excuse for being grim and boring. Quite the reverse! Secure in God and His salvation, the true and natural way is to laugh at ourselves and at this world, and to seek and find the joy in it. God’s world is brimming with joy if you are willing to look. All joy is from God and is a fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22). The joy of our salvation means, not least, that I have received God’s help and love in my life, really and concretely; now it’s time to play.\n\tBut O for a willing spirit! How do I become 'willing?' The will is God’s specialty. We try so hard to change our wills and our desires, and we are so bad at it. God is good at it though. He knows how to change desires deep down, where it counts; He tinkers far below in the dark, in the foundations, the 'archaeology' beyond our reach that drives our actions. And, inscrutably and frustratingly, God also knows when not to tinker.\n\tThis means that the way to engage the will, the path to a willing spirit, is not effort but prayer. 'God, go down there, down where I cannot reach, down into the dark mess where the secret engines are. Make the changes I cannot make. Grant me a willing spirit each morning.'\n\t—Simeon Zahl"

Normally the skis act as a buoy, but both had come off of my feet, and as I tried to reach my foot down to find a foothold, no skis were there. \n\tA wave of panic came over me. My only hope was to cry out for help. My uncle, who was driving the boat, heard the cry and quickly circled around, reached down to pull me out of the water, and lifted me back onto the deck of the boat. \n\tThe feeling of helplessness and desperation is certainly not confined to drowning—as my life goes on, there are other circumstances where I feel like I did in that murky bay, hopeless even with my feet on dry land. \n\tIn college, I found myself in a situation in which I could not rescue myself. I wept night after night. There was nowhere to turn: my family had a hand in the difficulties, my friends were no help, and I was certainly no help to myself. I was alone in a very scary place. \n\tWe all seek footholds in these places, but when the situation is hopeless, or the bottom falls out of what foothold you had, then what? We find ourselves in a situation beyond self-help, and as the waves begin to overwhelm us, we can only call out for help. \n\tSomeone once said that God’s office is at the end of our ropes. Just when He seems furthest away, God is, in fact, unimaginably close to those in distress. Even in the darkness of Jesus’ death, when God seemed to have turned His face from the world, God was most powerfully demonstrating His love for us. \n\tWhen we cry out in these places, His arms are the only ones able to reach us and save us. In these moments where we are completely overwhelmed, the Lord Jesus is there as our sure foundation.\n\t—Andrew Pearson"

		"verseText": "We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation. You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.",
		"text": "This psalm is subtitled 'A prayer of Moses, the man of God.' Whenever I read the Ten Commandments, I can’t help but imagine the expression Moses wore when getting to number six: 'You shall not murder.' Of course, being face-to-face with God, he was probably in a completely maniacal state, but I like to think that hearing this sixth commandment could have sent an extra shiver down his spine. \n\tI only think so because it may have resurrected a ghost long buried in Moses’ mind. After killing an Egyptian slave driver in Exodus 2, Moses flees the country in fear and doesn’t return until a new Pharaoh is appointed. Upon his return, everyone has clearly moved on, and we don’t hear of Moses’ crime again.\n\tYet who has ever done something wrong and successfully buried the deed? As William Faulkner said, 'The past is never dead. It’s not even past' (Requiem for a Nun). Even if society does not find fault with you, the conscience can be powerful enough to sentence your spirit for life. Every time I’m reminded of a regrettable decision or a slip of the tongue, my past becomes my present all over again. Despite our fleeing and keeping our sins secret, we cannot escape the light of God’s presence. \n\tAgainst our will, God continually reveals our secrets to set us free from them. As terrifying as that sounds, so often the things that keep me from living in the present are the mistakes of my past, and the only freedom I will ever have from them rests in God’s revealing light. \n\tWhat comes least expected is that when we are fully exposed, Jesus is there to cover us in his mercy and love. Moses’ prayer ends with, 'May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.' Indeed, when we are naked and ashamed, God’s favor is there, resting on our shoulders.\n\t—Sam Bush"

Seminary, pastoral ministry, post-graduate theology work—I’ve reached a point where I feel more like a producer than a consumer. I generally have difficulty listening to sermons because I am filtering them through my own approval. I know where the liturgy is going on Sunday. I can strike up conversations with all sorts of people in the congregation, and I can usually make them laugh. I resent handing out bulletins at church because, truth be told, I would rather be up front disseminating my knowledge. \n\tIt’s not all a bowl of lemons, though; don’t get me wrong. I still enjoy worship and love people. I still pray and read the Bible. I just feel different than I did during the more exuberant days as a fresh-faced believer. Like a child grown weary with his toys, I long for something else, something more real, perhaps. I wonder at times, Is this all there is to it? Do I have to spend the rest of my days on a Christian safari, hunting for that rare and elusive contentment? Even the Law-Gospel idea wearies me. I know what I am supposed to think, and I know what so-and-so said about this-and-that—I just feel indifferent to them at times. Some people struggle with the allure of gambling or alcohol; I struggle with Christianity. Do you? \n\tWhat to do? Left to myself, I will continue evaluating until there’s no tomorrow. However, what the psalmist tells me here is that despite my recalcitrance, God does not expect me to play-act my way through life. He refuses to deal with you and me according to our sins, and He actively separates our sins from us. The yawning chasm of His forgiveness is as wide as east is from west, and it is perpetually fixed there. For those of us whose feet are shuffling toward Sunday, think on the psalmist’s words as they apply to faith-resistant hearts: I may get tired of church, but this is probably why I never get bored with the fact that God loves me, even when we I lose sight of the bigger picture. Though I may tire of theologizing, God’s cross-shaped mercy does not weary me because it is the one thing I cannot master—it masters me. This is the filament that brings God’s stubborn light where I am dark.\n\t—Dylan Potter"

The actors and the scene shuffle around, but the scripts have not changed: the same argument with our spouses about money, the same frustrations at work, the same patterns of procrastination and self-sabotage, the same frustrations with stubborn parents and siblings and children, the same worries about what lies ahead. Year after year for a lifetime, we live for a future that never arrives. 'When we finally have an income like that, we’ll be able to do all the things we want.' 'Once this stressful period in my job ends, I’ll finally be able to relax and spend more time with the kids.' 'Once I finally meet the right person, my real life can begin.' But the moment never comes. The goalposts shift quietly back, and we’re returned again to the futurizing storyline, the same longing for a golden age ever delayed.\n\tGod’s Spirit is sent forth: a glorious whirlwind of creation, smashing old patterns and systems, opening up strange and wonderful new possibilities, infusing dead ground with life again. When God is involved, creativity and renewal come to marriages, to callings, to churches, to writer’s block, to broken hearts. God’s Spirit brings hope and life and the unexpected.

With trouble comes the accusation that I failed to plan well, or that I cut corners, or I forgot something. What about the deeper woe? At the death of a loved one, the memories and the what-ifs are horrible to endure. And when someone I love suffers, I strain with helplessness and awkward words. \n\tI believe I am describing a burden we all share. As much as woe itself, we fear the judgment that comes with it. This includes the judgment of faithlessness: knowing that we shouldn’t fear because we can trust the Lord to work good in everything. We shouldn’t fear the burdens of life, but we do. \n\tIt is good to hear that the Lord knows all this. Just hearing that is a reprieve from pretending bravery. But then we also hear the promise that God’s steadfast love and mercy endure forever. This promise, for now and always, frees us from our constant striving to prevent bad times, and it rebukes our anxious what-if thoughts. Though our fear may remain, His steadfast love is specifically given to those who suffer. \n\tOnce, I was fretting terribly, and then I saw on the floor a tiny heart-shaped leaf, miles away from where it grew.

		"text": "I love road trips. I love getting in my truck with a cup of coffee and music for the road, knowing that I have a long drive in front of me. Choosing albums for the drive is one of the best parts about getting ready for a road trip—some U2, Neil Young, Elton John, some Brian Regan for laughs and Mozart for sophistication. For me, no road trip is complete without the proper tunes. One of my favorite movies, Elizabethtown (2005), culminates with a classic road trip sequence, replete with a moving soundtrack.\n\tSongs for the road are nothing new. Psalm 124 is a 'Psalm of Ascent' or 'Gradual Psalm,' one of the fifteen psalms that were recited or sung by the Israelites while walking to Jerusalem for one of the major annual feasts. Psalms 120 through 134 were their songs for the road. Psalm 124 is a road song reminding us of something we often forget: God is on your side. It begins by reminding you twice that God is on your side: 'If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, let Israel now say—if it had not been the Lord who was on our side...'\n\tAs you know, it’s easier to believe God is on your side when life’s going well, when you’re feeling blessed by God. But it doesn’t stop there, because the good news is that God is on your side when things are not going well. God is on your side especially when things are not going well.\n\tSometimes people in our lives—including ourselves—rise up like enemies. And there are other times when we are overwhelmed by circumstances that simply happen. As Psalm 124 demonstrates, there are times in our lives when we feel swallowed up by other people, or by our own mistakes, times in our lives when we feel like we’re drowning—in sorrow or sickness or despair or debt or any number of things. At times we find ourselves utterly overwhelmed, in situations that are bigger than us, situations in which only God can help.\n\tIn these situations, God 'has not given us as prey' because God the Son, Jesus Christ, was given for us. Jesus gave himself over to death on the cross because God is on our side, and because God is on our side, even death is not the end of the story. Psalm 124 tells us, 'If it had not been the Lord who was on our side... [our enemies] 'would have swallowed us up alive.' But God is on our side, and as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, even death, the last and greatest enemy, 'has been swallowed up in victory... thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord, Jesus Christ' (1 Cor 15:54b, 57).\n\t—Dave Johnson"

Summer camps held emergency board meetings to decide how they would stay open year-round, to accommodate all the free time that the American public would soon have on their hands. The frenzy displayed an astonishing lack of insight on the part of our forebears. Technological advances have not increased rest. Just the opposite!\n\tAn editorial in The New York Times went so far as to describe us as a society that has gotten caught in 'The Busy Trap': \nIf you live in America in the 21st century you’ve probably had to listen to a lot of people tell you how busy they are. It’s become the default response when you ask anyone how they’re doing: 'Busy!' 'So busy.' 'Crazy busy... obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.6F \nIt’s true: for a great many of us, busyness has come to serve as a barometer of identity and, therefore, self-worth. We use non-stop effort as a means of comforting ourselves, in other words, and placating the voices of condemnation in our lives. Does this ring any bells? How busy are you? \n\tWhat would it say about you if you weren’t busy? Clearly nothing good. Yet our inability to rest has consequences. Reports of migraine headaches increased by nearly 60% over the last twenty years.7F \n\tThe psalmist tells us that God is a God of rest. 'He gives to his beloved sleep.' What a beautiful image! The verdict that we are so afraid of, the one that drives so much of our compulsive activity and 'anxious toil'—that we are not enough somehow—has been dealt with, once for all. It is secure. When God looks at us, He does not see anything that needs to be done. He is not waiting for us to do more or to be more. And no amount of scurrying around can change that. \n\tSo where are you caught in the busy trap? Where do you believe that if you don’t do it, no one will? Where are you growing weary? Perhaps today is the day to slow down and take a break. 'You can close your eyes' (J. Taylor).

I’m not much better now; I’m maybe just better at shushing the initial impulse to call home every time I need an oil change. Whether you know homesickness, or know instead the jet-set alternative, I believe there is something to be said of home-hunger in the deeper sense, a feeling of homesickness or pariah-hood that is elemental and biblical, as we see in the psalmist’s cry from the shores of Babylon. \n\t'Lord, how can we go on like this?' he says in the fourth verse. Where is my comfort? Where is my home in this new place? Where can I hide? Where is my familiarity, my comfort in this land of desolation? This rootlessness is everywhere: whether it’s a new job in a new city, whether it’s the death of a friend, the betrayal of a spouse, losing standing at work, losing money at work, or a season of unexplainable depression, we remember intimately our places of desolation. The walls of the familiar temple are gone, and we are left without shelter. So what can be done?\n\tHe continues his prayer in the fifth verse: 'If I forget who has made me, let what I’ve made crumble before me!' It is a common yearning: help me to remember home, what’s most important, where I come from, in whose hands I rest. Now that the temple is miles away, now that my walls have crumbled, remind me that I’m not alone. The psalmist’s prayer is rooted in the solid ground of the Gospel, the message that when the temples of comfort fall, when suffering brings forth a new and strange land, the hope of the Lord’s loving provision remains. Hard times remain hard times, and yet they are intimately shared with Him who loves us. We are not forgotten. In a foreign land, the Lord’s song of unremitting love abides. \n\t—Ethan Richardson"

So all visions of surfing perfect waves, jumping waterfalls, finally dunking a basketball, and recording with Billy Joel are out the window, because instead we’re just going to 'praise God' in a never-ending church service. And who is this God who has designed eternity around Himself receiving praise from His creatures? Who is this God who even now commands us to praise him? Does he really need the boost?\n\tOf course I knew there had to be more to it, but it wasn’t until a couple of years ago that I read something that turned all my thoughts upside down about the whole thing and made me want heaven (and God) more than I ever had. \n\tIt was an essay on 'praising' in C. S. Lewis’ Reflections on the Psalms. He had apparently been asking some of the same questions, including this one: why does it seem that the psalmist’s favorite way to praise God is simply to tell other people to praise Him? And not only people, but as we see in the above passage, stars and sea monsters and snowstorms! What is this all about? Lewis gives two simple observations:\n\tFirst, that God Himself actually 'demands praise' inherently. In other words, even if He did not command it, to praise God is simply to be awake, to be healthy, to be sane, to have 'entered the real world.' And consequently, not to praise Him is to have missed everything and lost all.\n\tSecond, he writes of our everyday lives, 'I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise.' Whether wine, music, books, sunsets, artists, sports, or children, we cannot fully enjoy a thing unless we praise it. Lewis continues, 'and just as men spontaneously praise what they value, so they spontaneously urge us to join them in praising it: ‘Isn’t she lovely?’'\n\tIn the same way, the psalmists praise God, the true and ultimate object of praise, by telling us (and everything!) to praise Him. And so I picture heaven as being kind of like the moment after a last-second championship win for the home team where you’re just grabbing your friends, shaking them, and saying, 'Can you believe this? Are you seeing this?' And there our praise, which is our happiness being fully directed toward the thing it was always meant for, will never end.\n\tIn the meantime, we may find ourselves more often resonating with the psalms of complaint (or revenge!) rather than the psalms of praise. But even then, we may find true comfort in the fact that we have a God who loves us enough to make His glory and our happiness ultimately the same thing. \n\t—Ross Byrd"

		"text": "We do so many things in life to try to justify ourselves before others in order to get them to love us or accept us. We take on false personas, we put on masks, to try and cover up the person we know ourselves to be, and yet still the person we fear everyone will hate and reject. We try to align ourselves with certain social cliques that we think will boost our status in the world around us. We labor to get into the best schools that we can, thinking that having our name linked with the name of that particular institution will give us clout and make people look at us in a different light. We even try to keep abreast of the latest fashion trends and the newest devices that the marketing machine has to offer us in the hope that people will see us wearing the right clothes or carrying the latest and best technology and, therefore, think that we’ll be somehow 'cool,' somehow worthy. \n\tFunnily enough, all these attempts at self-justification feel so right! When we are successful in our efforts to earn the love and acceptance that we so long for, it seems like we’re doing the right thing. In a word of judgment, though, this proverb rebukes: 'There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.' It certainly feels right, and yet the author of Proverbs says with confidence that these paths that feel right in the end lead 'to death.' In other words, those paths that offer us comfort, love, and peace in this life will ultimately lead us in the wrong direction because they only attend to the 'now.' You may feel justified now, you may even feel loved and accepted now, but ultimately, in the face of death, these feelings will only be a series of passing feelings. \n\tWhere do you find these self-justifying attempts in life? May we come to see that it is only the justification of Jesus Christ that really matters. His justification, his love and acceptance, ultimately mean everything in this world and in the world to come, and there is nothing that you can do to earn any of it. He gives it to you as an absolutely free gift. He gives it to you because in His love He wills to give it to you. And He gives it to you by the words, 'I forgive you.' This, and this alone, is the path to life.\n—Kyle Tomlin"

		"verseText": "Faithful are the wounds of a friend.",
		"text": "We, of course, expect wounds from our enemies. And the person without enemies is the person without convictions, without conscience, without passion. 'Beware when all men speak well of you,' said Jesus, a man who, as we know from the Gospels, knew an enemy when he saw one.\n\tBut it is wounds from those who are our friends that surprise us and hurt us the most. We expect our friends to be trustworthy, kind, understanding, and forgiving. When they are not, we are often undone. The hurt we feel goes deeper the closer that friend was to us, because the magnitude of the hurt is always measured by the magnitude of the loyalty that it breached. It’s what made Jesus’ death so utterly painful. 'He came to his own, and his own received him not' (John 1:11).\n\tIn Proverbs 27:17, the writer hails the virtues of friendship: 'As iron sharpens iron, so sharpens a man the countenance of his friend' (KJV). We know, therefore, that the writer is no cynic, looking at relationships as unimportant and expendable. No, he knows that, difficult though they are, they are critical to our well-being and growth.\n\tSo maybe the writer here is talking about those wounds that are aimed at our betterment, and not at our destruction. Occasionally someone 'cares enough to confront,' and we are given the grace to change. Not often. Most of the time we react, and we take those hurts far too personally. \n\tBut what if God is our great wound-er? As the writer of the Hebrews puts it, quoting a Psalm (94:12), 'the Lord disciplines him whom he loves' (12:6). As misguided as our friends’ judgments often are, even they can be used by God to help us.\n\tI recall a time when I got a verbal thrashing from someone of another race whom I had treated less than respectfully. The person was doing something stupid, but that didn’t excuse my abrasiveness, which very likely had an unhealthy dose of racism built into it. The reason why honesty hurts so much is because we believe something else about ourselves. We do not think that we are capable of the offense we have caused. I certainly don’t think of myself as a racist, but I clearly came across as one to my friend. \n\tWhat if we had a different view of ourselves? What if we agreed with the Bible’s low, low anthropology? We would see ourselves as capable of anything and, by default, guilty. When confronted with the truth by another we would not respond with defensiveness but rather with humility and repentance. The forgiveness found at the cross sets us free to do exactly that.\n\t—Peter Moore"

		"text": "So often this Proverbs 31 woman is used as the benchmark for what a 'Christian woman' is supposed to look like. She has a clean and beautifully decorated house: obedient children taught, gardens tilled, fruits gathered, meals made, clothes washed and pressed; she is tirelessly put-together, diligent, well-versed, resourceful. She is a servant to all, both privately and publicly. For all intents and purposes, she is upstanding in her thoughts, words, and deeds. In Christ, it is thought by many, we are given the power and the ability to actually become this Proverbs 31 woman; she is woman’s prototype, who we are (and, of course, want to be). \n\tThis certainly is a tall order. I am exhausted just thinking about it. The first question we should ask about this poem when we hear such literal application is: 'Are we really to take this poem literally, as a check-list for what we, women, are to look like?' And the answer is: No. This poem needs to be understood as poetry; it is an alphabetized list from A to Z (in the Hebrew), defining a woman metaphorically. As with metaphors in English poetry, one looks to what is being conveyed. To take this poem literally is to lose the beauty of the author’s message of restoration. \n\tThe Proverbs woman is the epitome of what it means to be in Christ, thus restored to God, thus restored to her neighbor. The author conveys to his audience that this is not just Eve, but Eve restored. \n\tThe very end says it all: restoration falls not on works but faith. After all that has been said of this woman, only one thing matters: 'a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.' As in Proverbs 1:7, it is the fear of the Lord that is 'the beginning of all wisdom.' \n\tFear of the Lord is not from our own works or abilities—the entire Old Testament demonstrates that our faith is fleeting. Fear of the Lord is demonstrated instead in Jesus Christ, the 'True Israelite' who fulfills God’s Law for us. It is only by Jesus that we are able to see, for real, our true place in relation to God, which is restoration.\n\tWe should not be over-laden with guilt because we don’t have obedient children or tilled gardens or Scripture memorized. Rather, we are this woman because Jesus Christ has made it so. It is by the fear of the Lord, by faith and not by works, that we are saved.\n\t—Lauren R.E. Larkin"

Thinking pleasure might escape meaninglessness, the writer of Ecclesiastes came to the same conclusion. But I often think the same way: life would be so much better if I could sleep in late, have a nice breakfast, spend the morning playing Halo, spend my afternoons walking my dogs in the park, and enjoy an endless romantic evening with my wife and a bottle of wine. My life then, without any extraneous demands, would be fulfilled. \n\tThis belief system means I live my life always looking forward to my next vacation, where I can finally live life as it’s meant to be lived.\n\tThe trouble that the writer of Ecclesiastes finds is that the pursuit of pleasure fails to give any lasting meaning. Pleasure is unable to alleviate the pain of life. At the end of the day, he says, pleasure of its own is 'chasing after the wind.' Despite the fact that we all look forward to the next big thing on the calendar—whether it’s the next episode of a favorite TV program, the coming weekend, the car classifieds, that new book in the mail—the enjoyment of its arrival is fleeting, and we look forward again, disappointed. \n\tThe love of God is the only salve for the vanity of life. True satisfaction is found not in pleasure but at the foot of the cross of Christ. It is the place where our pursuit of meaning and purpose finds its death, and where true meaning is born and freely given. \n\t—Todd Brewer"

		"text": "In a former life, I worked extensively in banking, in the nonprofit sector where there are all sorts of worthy causes that do a great deal of good. In this one instance, I worked on a nonprofit entity that was struggling financially, and one of the executive managers of the bank was on its board of directors. This manager had a long record of service in the bank and was highly respected for his contributions and financial shrewdness.\n\tThe financial condition of the nonprofit began to deteriorate and the executive tried with all his might to help. He was personally tied to it and genuinely wanted to see it succeed. Well, the financial deterioration increased in severity and, finally, action had to be taken to protect the bank’s interest. This was done, but there was an additional caveat. A head had to roll. It turned out that this executive manager who had given so many years of dedicated and competent service was fired. To add insult to injury, there were certain ambitious young managers who gleefully and smugly approved of this 'justice.'\n\tPerhaps you have seen this happen in whatever part of the world you live and work in. Maybe it was a coach who gave years of successful service, impacted many young lives, had a bad season, and then was fired immediately. Maybe it was a pastor who had a public moral failure and was subjected to a self-righteous feeding frenzy.\n\tThe givens of life very quickly destroy two naive notions: cause-and-effect and self-created identity. Cause-and-effect basically says that you will get out of a thing what you put into it. For instance, if you read your Bible, good things will happen (commonly called 'magic'). If you succeed academically, you will be accepted into Stanford Law, work on Wall Street, marry the man of your dreams, and have a fulfilled life. This is a terrible myth, as the former bank executive will be quick to tell you. The empirical fact is that life will, eventually, crush cause-and-effect thinking.\n\tAnother thing that dies is the idea of a self-created identity. This is baldly prevalent in the United States, but it is the same in Africa or anywhere else. It is Aristotle’s idea that 'you are the sum of your actions.' If this is true (and it is if there is no Christ) then life is 'vexation' and 'striving after wind' because you have to re-create your identity every day for your entire life. Even if you were to theoretically succeed, the end of your life comes and you are quickly forgotten. Your gains are distributed among others, and the whole process begins anew.\n\tI invite you to despair of cause-and-effect thinking and self-creation.

Everything we build up in an attempt to find purpose, all that we acquire in an attempt to satisfy, never delivers. It all ends in vain. It is a hopeless picture Solomon describes, and he is describing life itself.\n\tIt is offensive. Solomon leaves no rock unturned. He says that wisdom is vanity, self-indulgence is vanity, work is vanity, wealth is vanity, honor is vanity. Everything that we stand on, that we use to justify ourselves before God, is pointless. We balk—'Surely all of my effort at work to make a better life for my family is worth something!' Or, 'What about the fact that I gave up my Thanksgiving to serve the poor?' Or, 'How about the fact that I work as a minister full-time?' It is all vanity. All of it will come under judgment, and none of it will prevent death. Death is the lowest common denominator for Solomon. \n\tSo what does matter for Solomon? What is not vanity? Nothing we do, but everything God does. God’s work endures forever, and it is complete. There is nothing for us to do that is of any value that God has not already done. His work, and more specifically His work through His Son’s death and resurrection, has accomplished all that matters to us in life. There is nothing we can do to add to it or to take away from it. He has conquered death.\n\tWe can rest in this knowledge that God’s work on our behalf is complete.

Good news, then, becomes a matter of life being restored to former glory, to what we once knew. It doesn’t take much to see this is not where we live but that, instead, we are born dying in a dead world. We are born subject to sin, and so our starting point is not purity but sickness.\n\tWe don’t believe this in practice, though. We tend to con ourselves by calling one other to higher moral ground, by appealing to one another’s good will and natural ability. We buy into the advertisements that say, 'It’s up to you to make a change.' There’s a satisfaction that comes from believing that we are the primary actors and that our fate is in our hands. Purpose comes from the myth that if we improve, eventually we’ll figure out how 'to form a more perfect union.'\n\tThe Bible doesn’t have such a generous starting point. Instead, we are born into the winters of sickness, hatred, adultery, theft, fear, war. It is in this starting point, not despite it, that any real hope is recognizable. It is here, in the real presence of an absence, that good news is any good at all. Like a slave being freed, a refugee being brought home, a lost child being found in a crowd, this is the starting point from which comes real redemption. It is also why Jesus said, 'Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners' (Mark 2:17). Those who do not think they are sick do not recognize the doctor or the health he offers.\n\tThis is why Jesus taught God’s Law to its highest degree; he knew it would perpetually show everyone his or her starting point. Without this, we would not recognize the winter around us, which means we would never understand the spring.\n\tWhere is your starting point today?

My boyfriend was waiting in the hallway—my boyfriend who had secretly traveled from Pittsburgh to Paris that night to surprise me—and got down on one knee. I said yes. I absolutely loved him and wanted to be with him, but in the back of my mind I was very disappointed. \n\tI had struggled with anorexia ever since we met during high school—it was my secret life behind all the Christian leadership roles and academic achievements. I had had a very powerful recovery experience through the help of some wise therapists, but during my semester abroad I had gone back to the old friend—or enemy, I should say—to cope.\n\tSean proposed to me in a period of real failing—failing as a devout Christian who had been in therapy and had a supportive family. I wanted to be a lot more 'figured out' by the time I got engaged. I wanted to be engaged in strength, not weakness. I wanted to hide my flaws, my 'foxes' as the passage says. Subconsciously, in 'the cleft of the rock' so to speak—I expected judgment and rejection; I sort of even sought it out, because it had been the voice in my head for so long. Shouldn’t he wait? But he didn’t. \n\tOur default modus operandi is repression. We stuff away all the fears and failings because we don’t know what to do with them, and we try to carry on. A line in one of the songs by The Killers reads, 'I offer you survival, it’s hard enough to live.' Honestly, that’s where most of us are, I think, merely surviving something: our marriage, our job, our isolating habit. We survive and then cope. \n\tSo the big question becomes: who can save us—from egocentric, self-destructive repression? Nothing but love. Not the way we do it but unremitting, unconditional, biblical love. This love refuses to deny our issues. It stays with us there and won’t ever let us go. This love, too, compels us to love: 'I am my beloved’s, and he is mine.' \n\tI take comfort that this love was not deterred by whatever it is that I got myself into on my semester abroad, or what you may be into at 8 a.m. in your pajamas. You haven’t been expecting this kind of love. It is alien to your whole way of operating. And yet it’s true. He has decided to put an end to all the judgment and condemnation that drives you into hiding. He has forgiven all. He has overcome your attempts to sabotage His love and isolate yourself. May God continue that work of love in your life today. \n\t'O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crannies of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.'\n\t—Kate Norris"

Saints know their sin better than do criminals. It is for this reason that Christians who understand grace are much more readily able to cry when something sad happens, to apologize when they make a mistake, and to laugh at themselves when they do something stupid.\n\tChristian people cannot be defensive because, in encountering God’s grace, they have come to understand themselves to be people of 'unclean lips.'

		"text": "When it comes to yokes and shoulders, two movie scenes spring to mind. One is from The Mission (1986), and the second is in Jet Li’s Twin Warriors (1993). In the first film there is a powerful scene of a man who is part of a Spanish expedition in the New World—as penance for a murder he has committed, he is dragging a net filled with armor, swords, and metal up a waterlogged cliff. One of the 'natives' sees his struggle, climbs down, and cuts the cords.\n\tThe second film is a fantastic kung fu flick: Jet Li’s character, Junbao, is wounded by a friend’s betrayal. One day in a field he sees two peasants running back to their village—they have just found out one of their wives is about to be sold into labor camps. However, the husband can’t keep up due to the huge load of wood he’s carrying, and his friend has to convince him to drop the load; otherwise, he’ll never make it in time. Witnessing this simple event is cathartic for Junbao, who goes on to learn Tai Chi and defeat his enemies. Per usual.\n\tOur passage today is about burdens. Isaiah is foretelling a time when Israel will go into exile for their continued disobedience towards God. This exile is not without hope, and Isaiah sees a time when 'his burden will depart from your shoulder.' While most of us have never had our homeland destroyed and been shipped off to a foreign land as slaves (although that sadly still does happen in our world), we are no strangers to burdens. Christianity’s understanding of relief is much more in keeping with The Mission than with Twin Warriors: our relief is not something we are able to do for ourselves. It must be something done for us, or better yet, to us.\n\tThe answer to lugging burdens is not getting to the top of the hill with them, or even dropping them, but being cut free from them. We often try to release them ourselves—a futile task. Someone must come and act for us. That was Isaiah’s message to Israel, that God must come and deliver them from their own disobedience and evil. That is our message for Christianity, too: not the newest issue for better tips on burden-lugging, but freedom from it in the presence of a deliverer.\n\t'It is for freedom that Christ has set us free, stand firm therefore and do not submit again to the yolk of slavery' (Gal 5:1). This is the good news, that God Himself came down and said, 'Come to me all you who are weary, and I will give you rest, for my burden is easy and my yolk is light' (Matt 11:30).

Paul talks about this answer in his letter to the Corinthian church. 'For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive' (1 Cor 15:21). Isaiah talks about him here, thousands of years before he was born: 'He will swallow up death forever.' \n\tBoth physical and spiritual death were swallowed up at the cross of Christ. There Christ proclaimed, 'It is finished,' and this was certified by his resurrection three days later. While the physical expressions of death will one day be destroyed, the spiritual reversal is already here.\n\tThe answer to our problem is not self-help gurus or motivational speakers or life coaches.

		"text": "The disciple Matthew references this prophecy to describe Jesus: 'many followed him, and he healed them all and ordered them not to make him known. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah...' (Matt 12). There’s not much weaker than a bruised reed or a faintly burning wick: a stepped-on branch cannot right itself, a smoldering flame cannot reignite; they are both in danger of being crushed forever by a careless foot or a single well-placed breath, and yet this is the forethought of the gentle and compassionate Jesus. \n\tI used to think this passage applied to those who were truly weak—you know, 'the least of these'—the poor, the disabled, people suffering under terminal illnesses. And this didn’t apply to me: I was strong, I led a youth group, I ran Bible studies. And then came a time when I doubted, my life grew dark, and I couldn’t pull myself out of it or rekindle my faith, and I was scared. \n\tBut how many of us really are bruised reeds and smoldering wicks? Maybe at times we stand straight and tall, burning brightly, but life itself does the damage, until we worry that one more mishap, one more failure, one more harsh word could crush us. And here, having become 'the least of these,' we see Jesus who says, 'I will not condemn you, I will not cast you out. I will heal you; come to me.' It is the gentle and no-less-powerful love of Jesus, who himself was subjected to weakness, that restores the weak at heart. \n\t—Sarah Richey"

		"text": "The people of God pause to see if a qualifier is attached to this promise, a bait-and-switch that might consign them to spiritual servitude. After all, who hasn’t suspected that God has something up His sleeve? Perhaps your faith is no longer as fresh as the day when Christianity 'clicked.' Since then, like Israel here, many of us have experienced years of faith where God’s covenant felt like legal clauses and insurance disclaimers. Rather than that first-heard Gospel 'Yes!', we have begun to think that Christianity is more about saying 'Yes!' to Someone who prefers saying 'No!' It’s sad, but we long for legalism. This 'Christianity of the fine print' is nothing more than an echo of Israel’s hollow-chested service here. \n\tWhere’s the zeal gone? Gone are the days when the most mundane events feel like pregnant opportunities for gospel-sharing, and in exchange comes the play-acting of the seasoned churchgoer. Hands in pockets, head bowed low, my spiritual maturity is a mumbled prayer, a way of saying 'Yes' to God while really saying, 'You’ve disregarded me—look at the sacrifices I’ve bestowed!' It goes without saying that this self-imposed martyrdom is a million miles from God’s 'Yes!' My lifeless 'Yes' to Him only adds to the trail of my empty sacrifices.\n\tI have been made aware that after two years in the church, the most difficult thing to believe is that God loves me. Being taken up into that kind of love means my reluctant sacrifices will pale in comparison—and my sacrifices are certainly easier to control. \n\t'Look,' says God, to Israel and to us, 'I am not petty. Let’s simply start again, with this: I am the Forgiving One.' Like Israel, we strain our ears for the 'however,' but it never comes. He reiterates for emphasis: 'I, even I, am the one!' How reluctant is the human heart! \n\tGod repeats this 'Yes!' over and over throughout Scripture, because that is simply who He is: God is for us, on our side. The persistence of His 'Yes!' is offensive, but take that away and we have the cold comfort of religious procedure. Though we may not feel zealous today, the Ancient of Days is not putting us on: He knows we can’t carry the load of religious requirement for long, so He continually shoulders it for us.\n\t—Dylan Potter"

When my wife saw me at mile twenty-two, neither she nor I knew if I would survive the rest of the race. For the last few miles, I followed right behind another runner and tried to block out the pain. With three hundred yards to go, I finally saw the finish line with thousands of people cheering, including my wife screaming at the top of her lungs, rejoicing that I was nearly there. \n\tAnd though there can be glory in a marathon, its origin is a story of sacrifice—the first Marathon runner needing to get news to Athens, sacrificing his own body in the process, the story goes, dying immediately after delivering the news of victory (where the word 'Nike' comes from).\n\tIsaiah, too, tells of a watchmen’s joy when he sees the messenger who has run from the battle to proclaim the news of their army’s victory. 'We are free,' the messenger proclaims, 'Your God reigns!' The messenger’s feet cannot hold him another minute, but how lovely are his feet, which bring the good news. Good news comes to those of us who need it most, at a supreme cost to its messenger.\n\tIn Jesus, the fundamental messenger of Good News, the message of deliverance is conclusive. In him, we are delivered not from foreign political powers, but from sin and death—and what good news this is! St. Paul quotes this passage in Romans 10:15, referring to the messengers who preach this good news of Jesus. How beautiful are the feet of the weary messenger who has run the race to bring the news of salvation to those who are in need. \n\t—Drake Richey"

Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.",
		"text": "I love stories, you love stories, we all love stories. We like to read them, watch them, hear them, tell them, experience them. We always have and we always will. In fact, sociologist Christian Smith claims that our ability and propensity for storytelling is a big part of what makes us human. He calls us 'animals who make stories but also animals who are made by our stories.'8F \n\tListen closely the next time someone tells you their life story—or the next time you tell someone yours—and you will inevitably hear some kind of over-arching narrative. It may have to do with overcoming adversity; it may have to do with tragedy and victimhood; it may have to do with overriding social or political forces, or with success, failure, beauty, money, power, etc. It could be as simple as 'I was worse, but now I am better,' or as arbitrary as 'I used to have a difficult relationship with my mother, but now it’s much easier.' And there are the stories we tell ourselves, and the stories about ourselves that we buy into. As soon as we identify with these stories—i.e. who we have to be or want to be or should be—we set ourselves up to rationalize or straight-up deny any experiences or feelings that don’t fit. We all do it, but that doesn’t make it any less a recipe for loneliness and resentment.\n\tThe story we read here about God is a surprising one. It is not a story of triumph or glory. It is not a story of retribution or blessing or even joy. It is a story about those things that we tend leave out of the narratives we project onto God—namely, suffering, loss, and grief. That is because this is the story about Jesus. Which means it is a story of comfort for those whose lives haven’t followed a neat or consistent trajectory and sometimes don’t seem to make any sense at all. Tullian Tchividjian puts it this way: \nGod is not interested in what you think you should be or feel. He is not interested in the narrative you construct for yourself, or that others construct for you... Rather, He is interested in you, the you who suffers, the you who inflicts suffering on others, the you who hides, the you who has bad days (and good ones). And He meets you where you are. Jesus is not the man at the top of the stairs; He is the man at the bottom, the friend of sinners, the savior of those in need of one. Which is all of us, all of the time, praise be to God!9F\nSo what stories are you telling about yourself today? What stories are you telling yourself about God? Perhaps we might pray that we would be given fresh ears to listen to a new story: the story of a suffering servant who loves us as we are, not as we should be. The story that no one in their right mind would make up, especially not if they wanted anyone else to believe it. Unless, of course, it were true. \n\t—David Zahl"

		"text": "In his book The Shallows, Nicholas Carr talks extensively about a scientist named Michael Merzenich and something called 'neuroplasticity,' which basically means our brain will morph its circuitry in tandem with our circumstances and habits. Just in the last 50 years, we’ve learned all this complicated stuff about the brain that seems to put all the puzzle pieces together. It’s funny, though, because in that same chapter, Carr says that Aristotle thought the brain was a big blood refrigerator that 'tempers the heat of the seething heart.'10F It’s funny to laugh at how wrong he was, but Aristotle is one of the fathers of Western thought, and no one’s ever heard of Merzenich. \n\tWhether those reputations change in the next decade, or the next millennium, or they never do, one thing is safe to say: no matter how right we think we are today, we’re almost always going to look back with a little chagrin tomorrow. Says psychologist Jordi Quoidbach in the New York Times, we tend to have an 'end of history illusion,' the idea that the 'I wish that I knew then what I know now experience might give us a sense of satisfaction and meaning, whereas realizing how transient our preferences and values are (currently) might lead us to doubt every decision and generate anxiety.'11F In other words, we are good at laughing at our past selves, but we still tend to feel an earnest sense of propriety when it comes to the here-and-now. \n\tThis passage mirrors this sentiment, that we humans, despite thinking ourselves in circles for the right answers, will not find any fewer muddles and mazes along the line for our efforts. Isaiah says this is because 'our ways' are not 'God’s ways.' \n\tThough God is omnipotent and we are not, part of 'our way' certainly includes a misplaced sense of omnipotence. We are by nature strivers and fortune-seekers; for centuries we’ve used idioms with bullhorns and bootstraps; we will always tell stories of those destiny makers and dream chasers and do-it-yourselfers. We have promoted the narrative that our lives are for the taking, and we will continue to do so. And yet how hard it is not to think of Jesus coming upon a crowd of five thousand people and merely seeing 'sheep without a shepherd' (Mark 6). \n\tThis is the paradoxical wisdom of 'God’s ways' —not just that we humans are indeed not omnipotent, but that God subverts His own omnipotence for our sake. In Jesus, and most deliberately on the cross, we see 'God’s way' as impotence-unto-death, a way in which strength is weakness and weakness is strength. \n\tWhile laughing or crying at who you were ten years ago, and while facing your circumstances today, remember Aristotle’s brain fridge, and the lasting comfort that has made its home amidst all these transient tempers. \n\t—Ethan Richardson"

		"text": "Rise and shine! On first impression, this passage simply seems to be an exhortation to get up, make the best of it, and put on a good attitude. But how can such an exhortation take away the thick darkness described? If we rise, it is to a huge pile of responsibilities, and the way through is littered with things left undone, promises not kept. How can one shine when there is so much darkness within, interior closets of bad thoughts and faithless worry? \n\tIt is exhausting, really, this hiding in the dark, and deep down we wish to be known. We do want light. But on the other hand, light would show what we are hiding, and how poorly we use our time, and how often we worry needlessly—it is safer to keep that hidden, though the cry of despondency often comes: 'Who cares what I do? Does anybody?' \n\tIn this passage we hear that 'your light has come,' and we brace ourselves for exposure. Yet when the light of the glory of the Lord shines on us, we receive not condemnation but comfort; the Lord, who knows us no less because of His mercy, comforts His people and has compassion on them. His glory is revealed through forgiveness, perfect understanding, and the hope before us. This gift of light is Jesus Christ, who sees into us with the eyes of love and says, 'Child, arise.' \n\t—Robin Anderson"

		"text": "Freedom. It is not a word often associated with Christians. Not remotely. Yet freedom is an integral aspect of what Jesus was 'all about.' He caused quite the uproar when he applied this passage to himself (Luke 4), and we should take it at least as seriously as he did. After all, the German theologian Ernst Käsemann did not pull the title of his book Jesus Means Freedom out of thin air. Nor did Martin Luther when he wrote his historic treatise, The Freedom of a Christian.\n\tThere are many ways to define freedom in Jesus’ terms, but here’s one for today: it is the freedom from being responsible for your own value. This often then bestows the freedom to love other people.\n\tTake, for example, the coarse yet charming 2006 film Little Miss Sunshine, which portrays the collective nervous breakdown of the dysfunctional Hoover family. The son, who has spent a year in silence preparing to be an Air Force pilot, finds out that he is color-blind and unfit for training. The father, who has put his life savings into launching a self-help empire, receives the final rejection of his program. Their goals, which in themselves were noble and good, ultimately imprisoned them in tunnels of self-determination wherein they became completely unable to love (or even see) the other members of their family. But as their hopes are frustrated, something remarkable happens—they begin to care about each other. For the Hoovers, the breakdowns function as 'break-free' moments. \n\tThe cross of Christ both exposes the futility of our efforts at establishing ourselves and answers them. It ushers in the real freedom that we are loved and valued, not according to what we do, but what Jesus has done. That is, we are good because God is good, not because we are good. The shackles are off, once and for all! Perhaps today we can pray that it won’t take a Hoover-sized breakdown for us to see it.\n\t—David Zahl"

		"text": "There’s the old Shakespeare line, 'What’s in a name? / That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet.' (Romeo and Juliet). Juliet may not have made much of names, but our names have the tendency to transcend us. In the Bible, significant changes in a person’s life were accompanied by a change in their name: Abram was re-named Abraham—'Father of Nations'—after God declared him to be so (Gen 17:5). Jacob was re-named Israel—'God contended'—after wrestling with God until morning (Gen 32:28). Simon became Peter, the 'rock' on which God would build his Church (Mark 3:16). When God re-names people, He creates a new hope, something stretching much further beyond who they’ve known themselves to be. By changing their names, He changes their lives.\n\tAlthough names seem to possess less inherent meaning today, we still wish to be known as people whose lives mean something. We strive to maximize the positive traits by which we are known and minimize the jeopardizing ones, and sometimes we wish we were someone else altogether. We are not usually completely happy with who we are: we know well what we lack, yet we also lack the means to really change it. It is hard for us to render a new name in any sustainable or significant way.\n\tAnd yet the old story of a new hope is true for us: 'you shall be called a new name that the mouth of the Lord will give.' God promises that we will be known by a new name—a name that, in renaming, transforms us. No longer shall we be called 'Forsaken,' but 'Righteous;' no longer shall we be called 'Desolate,' but 'Delight of God.' The Lord has and will continue to transform us, and the first step is to call us by something different than what we are; He will name our righteousness into existence.\n\t—Bonnie Poon Zahl"

		"text": "Moralism, one of the great swindlers of the age, has come off so well because it’s successful in appealing to our pride. With moral righteousness, we can wear royal robes for doing great and 'selfless' deeds. The picture offered here in Isaiah 64, though, is that we are parading in our own soiled clothes. All your righteous acts—think about the charity drive, the listening good-friend moment, the dinner table prayer—God calls filthy rags.\n\tThere is a reason we do not boast in our morality or spirituality. Faith in Christ means we are not draped in our own rags but in the righteous robe of Christ. Isaiah writes, 'I delight greatly in the Lord, my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness' (61:10). Jesus has made the exchange, taking on ours and giving us his. This is what we call justification: the declaration of your righteous status before God.\n\tJustification is the polar antithesis of condemnation. While a condemned man is declared guilty and sentenced to death, a justified man is declared innocent and set free to live. In the Christian faith we flip the poles: born guilty, we stand condemned; yet with Christ for your righteousness, we are made righteous before God. His righteousness becomes our righteousness.\n\tThis is the wonderful doctrine of imputation. The righteousness of Christ is presently placed upon us, credited to our account, covering over 'the sins of the world.' And what a comforting and liberating doctrine! You may be strong today and weak tomorrow—life will always provide its peaks and valleys. 'Old sins' may re-emerge, or God may deliver you from them. You may make spiritual progress or spiritual regress. But there is no waxing and waning of the imputed righteousness of God. You are clothed in a love to which you can never add and from which you can never detract.\n\t—Justin Holcomb"

There’s definitely something to be said for keeping in touch with current friends and reconnecting with old ones. Just the other week, because of Facebook, I reconnected with my high school best friend after almost 15 years. On the other hand, I often dread what new old face is going to show up next in the 'People You Might Know' column off to the side—someone who hurt me, or whom I hurt, or who just frankly annoyed me. \n\tThe problem is that I like to imagine that certain memories and people in my past can somehow be left behind. The truth is that no matter how hard we might wish otherwise, our past remains with us and affects us today. We certainly don’t need Facebook to remind us of past hurt and guilt. The scars of previous relationships—with parents, siblings, friends, or spouses—affect our current ones. They can dramatically hinder our ability to love and to be loved. Our pasts have the potential to create something of a veil between us and the world around us.\n\tTrue healing is not about being fixed—about clearing up the veil—but it is about being remade, given new sight. It is about being loved when we are unlovable, seen as beautiful when ugly, and valued as perfect when we are anything but. It is that feeling we get when we meet someone who 'really understands me.' Unconditional acceptance—in spite of pasts, problems, and shortcomings—has tremendously transformative power. It has the potential to tear the veil 'from top to bottom.' \n\tThe Gospel is that no one understands us better or accepts us more than God. It is truly a mercy that we don’t remember everything we’ve thought, said or done; however, God does. In that darkness, He understands us as broken, desperate sinners more deeply than we could ever imagine, and He still loves us. The Gospel is that in that love He didn’t come into the world to tweak the Ten Commandments, or to help us live a little better. Instead, He came into the world to demonstrate that love, to save us from ourselves even though it meant death on the cross, a death bringing all 'things old' to death as well. 'Behold, I make all things new,' says Christ from the throne (Rev 21:5). The good news is that even if we can’t quite see that for ourselves right now, Jesus did and still does, and the cross is our assurance.

This is one of the constant themes—He not only knows the number of hairs on their heads, but even knows them before they were in their mothers’ wombs, and He knows them better than they know themselves. And this is true of life today, too. Even though we almost always 'look within' for the resources to accomplish everything, we don’t really know as much about ourselves as we think. \n\tOn one hand, this inadequacy leads us to despair, both of ourselves and our so-called abilities to do what the Lord asks of us. On the other hand, with the self-realization we so long for yawning beyond us, we are strangely brought to a place of freedom.\n\tJeremiah, coming to this impasse, is able to go out in strength because this power came from outside of him. Jeremiah is called by God, as they say, but Jeremiah’s ability to fulfill the calling was not contingent upon the depth of his résumé, but instead his complete reliance on the Lord to stand in for him and walk with him. Armed with only this, Jeremiah does the impossible because it was actually not Jeremiah doing anything, but the Lord doing it all. \n\tThis kind of supernatural strength is necessary for all of life, from birth to grave—it doesn’t just apply to Jeremiah or the Patriarchs. Life is a challenge that leaves all of us muttering, like Jeremiah, 'I do not know how to...' Are you in a job in which you feel way over your head? Struggling with a frigid marriage? A hapless child? Life confronts all of us with issues with which we feel woefully inept to deal. And God uses these things to show us the need for complete reliance. Just like Jeremiah, God is in the midst of it all, doing it all, while you do nothing. \n\tWhatever it is you are faced with in your life today, God has called you to this place, but He is not leaving you there.

The world takes it for granted that we are 'born free, as free as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows, born free to follow our hearts.' Jeremiah expresses a different view of our hearts—they are deceitful and desperately sick. Given that reality, who would actually want to follow his or her heart? \n\tA quick inventory of your own anger, lust, jealousy, greed, or self-preoccupation confirms Jeremiah’s diagnosis, not to mention Jesus’. Or maybe it’s your need to shop, or your miserly grip on your money, or your non-stop critical commentary of others. Or perhaps it is the malaise or boredom that has sealed you into the margins of life. \n\tIt could be that your unforgiving attitude or your chronic defensiveness is the culprit. And we haven’t even touched on your dependence on sex, drugs, work, thrill, or entertainment to get you through another year, another month, another day, another hour. Whatever the outward and visible expression of your sickness, we know the origin: the heart is deceitful above all things. \n\tThe good news about this bad news is that Christ takes it for granted that you are this way. There’s no need to pretend to be something you are not. That is gracious of him, isn’t it? And wise too. After all he is the One to whom 'all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid.' Adam and Eve tried to hide from God in the Garden after their own hearts were corrupted. But to no avail; God found them out just as He has found us out.\n\tThe other good news about casting your lot in with Jeremiah’s assessment is that you are now in a position to be found out, and thus saved by God. Lewis continues, 'Until we really feel this assumption of His to be true, though we are part of the world He came to save, we are not part of the audience to whom His words are addressed.' Once we agree with the diagnosis, there is the hope of healing.\n\tThe Gospel is always bad news before good; bad news about ourselves followed by the good news about God. In Christ, God comes to the slums of your heart to find and save you. As Jeremiah, the diagnostician of the heart, concludes, 'Heal me, Lord, and I shall be healed; save me and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.' \n\t—Paul Walker"

She saw herself standing on the banks of a lovely river running through a beautiful forest. Suddenly, she saw a man. He was walking on top of the water in the river.

He cries out, 'There is within me something like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot.'\n\tIn a movie called Stars in My Crown, an African-American man has been a wonderful grandfather figure to several generations of children in the town.

When he refuses to sell, things get ugly. The people whom he had counted as friends turn on him. It comes to a head when the former friends say, 'If you’re not off the property by sundown tomorrow, we’ll hang you.'\n\tAt the appointed hour the next day, the townsmen appear, hiding behind white hoods. A friend comes out onto the porch with the old man and says, 'John knows that he is going to die. He asked me to come out today and write his last will and testimony. He wants me to read it to you. He wants to give his fishing rod to Pete, because he remembers the first bass he caught with it.

There is a pulsing extended intro—'Pop Musik'—and Bono enters from the back of the stadium, on ground level, surrounded by bodyguards, in a boxer’s get-up. He plays the part as he approaches the stage-slash-ring, walking through the crowd with showtime heavyweight bravado, set on convincing the world (and himself) that he is larger-than-life. After nearly eight minutes, the entire stadium is frenetic with this masquerade; as the intro fades into the first electronic loops of the opening song, Bono’s swagger matches his alter ego point for point.

Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.",
		"text": "To be in exile is to be far from home. Anywhere you go that is not home is a place of exile. This does not just mean the home you grew up in—for example, you might find by your fourth year, surrounded by friends with whom you have shared so much, that your college feels more like 'home' than your parents’ house. Whenever leaving a place or situation is painful, scary, uncomfortable, or sad, that is the sign that you are going into exile. Sometimes home leaves you—you stay in the same place, but the people who made it so special move away.\n\tThe passage tells us something very important: that it is the Lord who is the author of exile. He is the one who sent you to the lonely place, the alien place, the difficult place, just as He was the one who made the old place home. To feel cut off from family, friends, and fellowship is in part to understand more truly the reality that we are 'strangers and exiles on the earth.' (Heb 11:13) \n\tThe second point here is that the way to deal with exile is to be open to it becoming a new home. The most difficult part is letting go of the idea that it is temporary—what if you are to stay there until your children have children, as in the passage? The reason any place can be home is that the Lord is the one who will always go with you, wherever you go. The one who animates friendships and creates fellowship, who fosters feelings of belonging and belovedness, is neither your family, nor your friends, in the end. It is the Lord. 'For in its welfare you will find your welfare.' The Lord has gone ahead to the new place; He has not lingered behind. Your welfare lies with Him, ahead, in the unknown future.\n\tThere is a further consolation, however, for Christians. It is that there is indeed a final Home, of which the safest, happiest place here is but a forerunner and a shadow. 'They desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.' (Heb 11:16)\n\t—Simeon Zahl"

		"text": "A few months ago, I was in a local grocery store where a clerk had neatly stacked this large pyramid of mac-&-cheese boxes. All of a sudden, a revved-up, red-haired three-year-old tackled the pyramid, scattering them across the floor. His clearly exasperated and embarrassed mother grabbed her child by the shoulders and said, 'Sam, I love you, but you can’t be a part of our family if you act that way.' \n\tThis passage from Jeremiah 31 highlights the chilling distinction between what theologians call the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. And it’s all to do with what’s acceptable and what gets you kicked out of God’s family. This Old Covenant, often known as the Law, is an elementally conditional relationship: blessing is promised for those who obey, but cursing for those who don’t. Jeremiah says that this covenant was broken by the people with whom it was made.\n\tLike the macaroni fiasco, it is easy to break up a conditional relationship, and Israel’s biblical history demonstrates this fact. But what is it? Is the moral content of the Law deficient? Does it point people in the wrong direction? No—it just demands more than humans can give; it expects a dead tree to bear fruit. There is thus a need for more.\n\tThe New Covenant is un-conditional. Here in Jeremiah, God promises not to break up with us; He’s simply going to 'forgive our iniquity and remember our sins no more.' This new relationship comes from the heart rather than command, and, therefore, love and all the other fruits of God spring from there. Whereas the old relationship showed a God of justice, the new one shows the foolish wisdom of God’s grace. \n\tWe learn in the New Testament that this new relationship is enacted by the forgiveness of God in Christ. He doesn’t ask our permission to forgive us, nor does He ask us to do anything to earn it or keep it. He simply forgives everyone. \n\tWhile the Old Covenant teaches that you will be accepted once you become acceptable, the New Covenant proclaims that you are accepted already. The forgiveness offered in the New Covenant flies in the face of justice and fairness—and this is wonderful news! Right here and now, you stand forgiven of everything you’ve ever done and will ever continue to do. This is what it means to be a Christian: to learn to cope with the audacious nonsense of this New Covenant. \n\t—Ethan Magness"

Not only does the suggestion ignore the fact that suffering is real and, therefore, impossible to manage, but also we cannot decide to feel better. Suffering itself is the ground upon which the slow work of 'moving on' happens. This slow work is God’s work, and it cannot be rushed or abandoned. \n\tIn Lamentations we have an entire book demonstrating God’s acknowledgement of and commiseration with human grief. Written after the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, the book communicates the sadness of an utterly defeated people.\n\tThere is no smoothing over in Lamentations, no positive spin or bright side, just this 'soul... bereft of peace' that has 'forgotten what happiness is.' \n\tThere is space given for anger, sadness, and even loss of hope in God. It is only after this honest confrontation with anguish that the author can then write, 'The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.' Because there is space to suffer, there is space for God’s healing work. There is no divine accusation or advice, but time and listening, which allow the sorrowful to finally return to the hope of God.\n\tGod not only understands our suffering; He personally suffered for our sake. Inherent in the cross is God’s answer to suffering: Jesus, the suffering servant, who was inclined not to the healthy but to the sick, endured the cross to be with us forever in our grief. \n\tOnly in God’s good timing are our hearts mended and our hope restored. This is not accomplished by willpower or by friendly advice. Instead, it is completely accomplished by the Man of Sorrows who allows us to say, 'Great is your faithfulness.' \n\t—Alex Large"

Should we be correct or should we be honest? Those two things often seem diametrically opposed.\n\tWhen we are honest, our prayers frequently devolve into wishes. The great doo-wop singer Dion gave us a powerful example of this phenomenon in 1975, when he and legendary producer Phil Spector recorded 'Make The Woman Love Me': \nLord, I know I haven’t asked for much\nIn such a long, long time\nNot since that brand new pair of Levi’s\nBack when I was eight or nine\nAnd I know, the world’s in such a state\nAnd you’ve got a lot to do\nBut if you ever find yourself with a minute or two\nWon’t you please make the woman love me?\nBoth the childhood prayer for jeans and the adulthood prayer for romance are sincere. Yet they sound more like a job for Santa Claus than God. I want, I want, I want!\n\tThen there are the 'correct' prayers, typified by the Lord’s prayer of 'Thy will be done.' Or even more daunting, 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me'—when you consider the outcome of that particular prayer, it becomes difficult to follow suit. These may be the right words, but they rarely come from the heart. At the least, the motives behind them are often mixed: 'If I just pray the right way, God will do my bidding.' 'If I can just figure out the right formula...' In other words, I want, I want, I want! \n\tIn this passage from Lamentations, these two types of prayer meet. We hear the cry of a person in despair, begging for relief from the only place it can come from: on High. It is a prayer that says, 'My will has failed me—your will is my only hope, please let it be done.' It is honest, and it is right. It says, I need, I need, I need! The answer comes back: 'Do not fear.' This is not only the answer we want; it is the answer we need and the answer we have been given. \n\t—David Zahl"

		"text": "It is miserable to have a heart of stone. Most Christians can remember some time when they knew what it was like to have a new heart and spirit—to be filled with joy and delight and mighty purpose for God, to wake up knowing that with God the world is new each morning, pregnant with possibility and meaning. As this fades and the heart fills again with dullness and weight, we like to tell ourselves that this is a consequence of growing up—that this is what Paul meant about being ready for solid food instead of milk. We hide our disappointment, sometimes by throwing ourselves into Christian activities, sometimes by taking up theology or some cause, sometimes by just drifting slowly away. We feel heavy, dull, rattling back and forth in the same old groove, the lustre faded.\n\tThe first thing is to know that the rationalizations are lies: the stone in the chest and the constriction in the lungs is not what we were made for, it is not what is being given in Ezekiel 11, and it really is miserable. We must first lodge our protest about the weight we have been given, not explain it away. Protest like this is a form of prayer.\n\tThe second thing is to push it, prod it, feel it, live with it, learn what we can about it. Come to accept the weight in the heart, the way kids have to accept the fact that the new sibling is not going anywhere. Everything is God-given. So give the weight the space to be turned into flesh again. God acts, desiccated veins fill again with Blood, the heap of bones reassembles, Spirit fills the lungs again. \n\tAnd whether it happens or not, you are still one of His own, and He will always be your God.\n\t—Simeon Zahl"

		"text": "At first glance this verse seems like a throwaway; it is better that I go ahead and explain why it is not. In the state of Alabama, Crimson Tide football is quite the spectacle. At a time when the whole southeastern part of the country was under derision for everything from civil rights abuses to educational standards, the Crimson Tide was winning championships. \n\tThis created a powerful attachment to the team and a transference of identity. What I mean by that is 'the team' became 'us.' Fans’ identities became direct correlations of the successes or failures of the football team. As I write this, 'we' are in the height of recruiting season (the 'second season,' we call it), and 'our' collective state of mind can actually be determined by the college decision of a 17-year-old. Let that sink in for a moment.\n\tThis brings us to the Scripture reading. Ezekiel 20:29 has been ballyhooed as the pro-Alabama portion of the Bible. Get it? 'Bama' has a place in the 'high places.' The only problem is that as much as people in Alabama go to church, they often don’t understand what the high places were. The high places were the places where idolatry ran rampant. They were obviously places that irritated God immensely.\n\tThis really fits, ironically—it really does. Idolatry, from what I make of it, is man’s attempt to control his fate. You carve out a wooden idol, infer a god, and try to appease it. Really, you do unto a god rather than have it do unto you. \n\tIn the same way, when you attach yourself to Alabama football, you are historically attaching yourself to a winner. When a game or championship is won, you win. In a way, you falsely impute your own identity by attaching yourself to a winner. And you get to let all the fans of Tennessee and Auburn know about it. Isn’t that the definition of what the Bible calls idolatry? Using the things that reinforce the enthronement of the self, you create your own identity rather than receiving the identity God has given us. \nGod, in grace, gives us more. God imputes on us a true and eternal identity—one that does not wax and wane with each neck-and-neck quarter, but one that stands guiltless and free, even in the offseason.\n\t—David Browder"

Ezekiel prophesies over this valley of dead, picked over, sun-bleached bones, and 'behold, a rattling...'—there are muscles and tendons and skin and hair and eyes, and life is breathed into them. \n\tIt almost reminds you of a Tim Burton film, doesn’t it? Burton is the master of the macabre: maybe you’ve seen one of his more recent movies, Corpse Bride (2005). In Corpse Bride, the art directors worked to create two different worlds where the movie would take place—Victorian England and the Afterlife. Ironically, the world of the living, Victorian England, was painted almost exclusively with grey tones: the people, the buildings, and the church are all greyscale, and the world of the dead has jazz music, vibrant colors, beer-guzzling skeletons and reanimated dancing corpses. The film’s mood seems to ask its viewer in simple terms: what if the world after this one is better than the world we’re in? What if life, love, and happiness come after we kick the bucket here on earth?\n\tEzekiel’s prophecy here promises what Tim Burton’s colorful underworld can only vaguely gesture. He speaks these words to Israel, who by this time is exiled from home. Israel pleads for help, with nowhere else to turn, to the God who has left them: 'Our bones are dried up, our hope is lost, we are indeed cut off.' This prophecy is the message of hope to them: you are dead, but you will be made alive. From dry bones in a valley, God will make you whole again—He will breathe you back into existence, just like He made you back in Genesis 2.\n\tOur situations may sound familiar. When the world hits us hardest, we start to see things in shades of grey. The realities of our own personal strife, of death itself, and the inability to escape either, all show through in Tim Burton’s ghoulish universe and in the universe of Ezekiel’s prophecy. And yet, God promises that He will not leave us here. He will raise us from the dead, filling us with His Spirit and, in doing so, will make certain we never forget we are His people. He has not just created us, proclaims Ezekiel, but will one day re-create us, breathing resurrection into these dead bones. \n\t—T. Bryan Jarrell"

If they refuse, as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego do, they are to be thrown into the fiery furnace. The three conquered Judeans trusted God could deliver them, but they did not know whether or not He would. Living in exile under this tyrant, with new Chaldean names, there is no reason why these three men should not have died. Even in their moment of faith, they must have wondered, what is God going to do?\n\tGod could have justified His men of faith and destroyed Nebuchadnezzar, who was an egomaniacal dictator, after all.

Nebuchadnezzar has lost it all. All remnants of the life he once had are stripped. It leaves him (and us) with a question: Why? And how is it ever going to be okay again? \n\tLike Nebuchadnezzar, we’re often pulled 'Undone,' as Robert Earl Keen sings: \nNow the storm’s comin’ and the sky’s turned black\nIt’s too late now you can’t turn back\nLightnin’ strikes on the telephone wire\nYou’re drunk as a skunk your shack’s on fire\nThe wife took the baby and the other two kids\nThe dogs are a-howlin’ and the chickens are dead\nIt’s your last night out and you’re gonna have fun\nThey’ll read it in the papers when you come undone.\nI was having a conversation with a new coworker during a professional development ice-breaker activity, about 'something no one knows about you at work.' I kept my cards close, telling her I used to be an occasional runner. In exchange, she told me that her boyfriend of four years was killed in a car accident three months ago. This happened to be the same coworker who, since her hire at work, had been forced to switch jobs three times, including a new position that, honestly, would kill anyone. She was sleepless, strung out, overcommitted, overwhelmed. I sort of gawked, asked her how she was even functioning, why she hadn’t quit by now. She shrugged, half-smiled, and said she was keeping herself busy. I couldn’t imagine, but then I kind of could. \n\tWe know our own places of desolation and wilderness, places where the familiar is exchanged for the foreign—and not in the good way—where suffering seems to be the milk you’re pouring on your cereal in the morning and there’s nowhere to go, no one to lean on. Lonely, strung out, beat up, in over your head, wishing you were anywhere else but here. Why is this a part of life?\n\tIt seems that Nebuchadnezzar’s hope in telling his story is to show that the Lord’s undoing is the doing of something new. The king’s humiliation ends in restoration, and this seems to be the answer. Everything is taken from him so that he might know, as he says himself, 'The Lord’s kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, / and his dominion endures from generation to generation.' His riches, his comfort are restored to him in excess—and 'greatness was added to him' in a way he couldn’t have known or expected. In losing everything, he is restored to that which gave him all he had to begin with. \n\tIt doesn’t make the hard times go away in any sense, and it may not even make them any easier at all—but it certainly founds them in the solid hope that, as Paul says in Romans 8, 'all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.' So in these places of despair and hopelessness, we have the hope that we have not escaped His good purpose and great love for us, and that an unexpected, invisible thing is springing forth new life. \n\t—Ethan Richardson"

The Law requires that God’s people live an upright life and have a pure heart; Daniel’s prayer demonstrates that this is impossible. We are in the same boat: we live in exile for our disobedience.\n\tIf God had known adherence to the Law would be impossible for us, why did He give it in the first place? Doesn’t He know all things? We find the answer in Daniel’s prayer: before the Law we reach an impasse, and this impasse brings us to our need for mercy—in our failure, we are driven to the grace given at the cross. Because of God’s sacrifice in Jesus, the Law’s temple curtain has been torn, and the impossible is forever possible; we stand in the midst of the presence of God. \n\tDaniel’s prayer illuminates one thing in particular: that God’s upside-down justice transcends our human understanding. Daniel’s hope is based on God forgiving the guilty and redeeming those who do not deserve to be redeemed, but this goes against everything we believe is rational or ethical. Why die for the thankless? Why forgive a person with a past? \n\tThough it is the basis of Christian doctrine—Daniel’s prayer has been answered, and we undeservedly receive the blessings of God—it is no less difficult to understand. Only in faith are we assured that we cannot get there on our own. Only in faith are we able to see it is in Jesus, who confesses this to us: 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life...' (John 14:6). \n\tThis is what Daniel’s prayer is all about: it is about Jesus. From the very beginning it’s been about him. Every breath out is a response to the first initial breath that went in (Gen 2:7). The Israelites were sent into exile because they failed to keep the Law; this was the failure promised in the covenant, and a failure that led them to hope. Jesus fulfilled this hope, and, thus, the blessings of a new covenant are realized: it may transcend our understand, but the exile is over. \n\t—Lauren R.E. Larkin"

		"text": "Hosea the prophet was called to marry a prostitute named Gomer. Though you might be willing to understand your lover’s love for 'cakes of raisins,' no one really plans or wishes to marry someone who has proven to be unfaithful, and certainly no one would want to marry someone who had once been unfaithful and continued to be so.\n\tHosea’s marriage to Gomer illustrates God’s relationship to an unfaithful Israel. In spite of the fact that Gomer is an adulteress, she is ransomed by Hosea, showing God’s love for His people in the face of their unfaithfulness. The Lord’s love for Israel remains untethered to any sinful behavior—breaking its bonds. God is faithful despite the ongoing reality that they are still unfaithful.\n\tThis message is often lost in churches today. Often we hear, 'If you behave yourself, then God, who loves you, will bless you. He chose you because He sees great potential in who you could be.' And why shouldn’t we believe this? This is how many of our relationships work. We often say to our spouses or family members, 'If you loved me, then you would...'\n\tBut this is not how God operates. God knows you are a conditionally bought-and-sold human being, and still Jesus’ death on the cross is the final declarative statement that God’s love for you is unconditional. As it is said, 'There is nothing that can separate us from the love of God' (Rom 8). It is not a love that forgives once or any number of times, but is timeless and unremitting. This is the love that brings redemption, even to those of us who often feel like Gomer.\n\t—Andrew Pearson"

I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And you shall know the LORD. I will have mercy on [the one I called] No Mercy, and I will say to [those called] Not My People, ‘You are my people’; and he shall say, ‘You are my God.’'",
		"text": "At the time of the writing of Hosea, Israel had been worshipping other gods—a thoughtless rejection deserving God’s own rejection: exile, death, damnation. That is why this passage is so shocking: rather than seething anger, God’s response to rejection is this impractical, frustratingly persistent affection.\n\tA resulting theme in this book is the issue of identity, of Gomer’s shift from slave to spouse. The last lines of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s poem, 'Whom Am I?' are relevant here: 'Who am I? / They mock me, these lonely questions of mine. / Whoever I am, thou knowest, O God, I am thine.'\n\tThough much of who we are will change, one thing that will not is the abiding acceptance of God—God will never let you go, even when you’re sure He’s unimpressed with you. Martin Luther gave us a helpful phrase to understand this phenomenon: simul justus et peccator—'simultaneously justified and sinful.' This is a realistic identity: according to your desires and actions, you are a sinner deserving judgment; however, because of God’s mercy on the cross, you are covered. God’s grace changes our identity problem. \n\tIf you’ve seen Fight Club you’ll remember Tyler Durden’s powerful diatribe against the false identities we assume: 'You’re not how much money you’ve got in the bank. You’re not your job. You’re not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You’re not your family. You’re not your problems. You’re not your age. You are not your hopes. You’re not your khakis.' \n\tIn the spirit of Durden (and Luther), you are not your real or perceived set of identifiers. You are not your divorce. You’re not your parents’ divorce. You are not your addiction or disorder or STD. You aren’t your pattern of dealing with relationships, your adultery, your anger. You are not your wallet or your wit. \n\tIsaiah tells us that our righteousness is as filthy rags, but it is Jesus’ robe of righteousness draped over us that God sees. We need a God before whom we can put aside the disguise—trusting that when He sees us He won’t turn away or smite us in anger. With this possible, for just a moment, the vicious habits of identity maintenance can stop, and we can step down onto the firm ground of acceptance.\n\t—Justin Holcomb"

Some of us even spend a lifetime huddled up in complaint or victimhood rather than reaching out to God or others for help. Why do we consign ourselves to despair?\n\tOne reason is that we believe our problem is too big or too hopeless for anyone to be able to help. We lack faith of any kind. We are like the invalid who had sat by the pool of Bethesda for thirty-eight years: we cannot get into the water because there is no one to help us, no one who can help us (John 5). Jesus asked the invalid, 'Do you want to be healed?' This is the first question we ought to ask ourselves when stuck with an intractable problem. \n\t Another reason is that we do not want to examine our pain because we think it will destroy rather than heal us. We fear facing our need, and we fear feeling our dereliction; crying out to God from our heart is simply too painful. It feels like death. What if there is no answer? What if God has abandoned us? \n\tWe prefer murmuring over going to the doctor. We know in our heads that anger and resentment hurt us more than the people at whom we direct them, but we cannot bring ourselves to face the source.

The bad things in your life have not escaped God’s notice, nor do they fall outside of His sphere of influence. This means that hurt and disease and disaster and death are all under His command and authority. \n\tMost of us want to shy away from this biblical view of God. We are loath to attribute anything bad to our good God. We are more likely to say that bad things happen because of sin and the devil. God then swoops into the mess to make things right. It is true that the devil is real and threatens to undo us. It is also true that we reap our own misery because of our sin. \n\tGod, however, is not a God on the sidelines, watching our lives unfold and rushing in to help fix what is broken. If God is omnipotent, as we say He is, then He could stop our hands from sinning and save us from our own misery. Satan, like everything and everyone else, is subject to His command. Affirming God’s sovereignty means concluding that God wields both healing and woe for His own good, yet often inscrutable, purpose.\n\tGod’s sovereignty is clear to Joel. God refers to the devastating plague of locusts as His 'great army which I sent among you.' The destroyers did real and severe damage in Israel, His chosen people; they brought years of loss built on more years of sorrow. Perhaps you have experienced what feels like years wasted in loss or sickness or suffering, or years spent idly or in vain—years you wish you could have back. The good and comforting news is that those years, and all years, come from the hand of God. And the better news is that God does not waste time—neither His time nor yours. \n\tHe doesn’t always provide an explanation of why He does what He does. The bad in the world will remain a mystery until the end of the world as we know it. But He does give us a promise we can trust: 'I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten... You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied.' It is His goodness and love that allows us to say in both the triumphs and trials of our lives that God 'has dealt wondrously with me' and to thank Him for everything that comes from His hand.\n\t—Paul Walker"

But when Amos appears on the scene, he says, 'Yes, there’ll be a Day of the Lord. But it will be an occasion for the Lord to purge everyone, not just the enemies of Israel. What God is going to purge,' says Amos, 'is pseudo-morality, wherever it’s found. God is going to say, I hate, I despise your feasts. Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.'\n\tGod grant that you and I encounter some women and men like Amos in our culture today. Because the 'abomination,' as Amos called it, of pseudo-morality and half-truth doesn’t seem to have been eradicated since the time of ancient Israel. There is so much pain all around us that’s not getting relieved by just saying the right words.\n\tSo let’s bring on the Day of the Lord. Let’s bring it on all the way up to—but stop just short of—the point where God says, 'I hate, I despise your feasts—Jim.' Because the Day of the Lord seems great, until it gets to me. \n\tI eagerly look forward to the day of truth-telling—until it’s truth-telling time about me. Then I start feeling like the five maidens who weren’t ready when the bridegroom appeared, who were shut out of the feast. Then I don’t want justice to roll down like waters, because I’d be washed away.\n\tBut the Day of the Lord has already arrived. Justice has already rolled down like waters. The wrath of God toward the pseudo-morality in me, and the judgment of God on the compromises I make—all of that wrath has already fallen. As another prophet put it, 'He was pierced for our transgressions... and with his wounds we are healed' (Isa 53:5). \n\tHere is how the Day of the Lord came to St. Nicholas Church in the city of Leipzig in what used to be East Germany. In the spring of 1989, Christian Führer, the pastor of St. Nicholas, decided one Monday evening to hold a prayer service for peace in the world. A few people attended. Pastor Führer held another prayer service the next Monday. More people attended. Into the summer, the Monday evening prayer service continued—and the numbers grew. The sanctuary of St. Nicholas can hold 1,000 people. By the end of the summer, the people were spilling out the doors. Every Monday night—no sermons, no political references—just prayers for peace.\n\tOn Monday, October 9, 1,000 people were in the sanctuary, and 70,000 more were in the streets, holding candles and singing hymns. The next Monday, October 16, there were 120,000 people praying for peace. The following Monday, there were 320,000—two thirds of the city’s population. On the following Monday, 500,000 people prayed and sang for peace. Ten days later, on November 9, the Berlin Wall came down.\n\tSo what justice do you long to see uncovered—at work, at home, abroad? What judgments do you fear might wash you away? And what peace might the Day of the Lord have in store for you?\n\t—Jim Munroe"

		"text": "Suffering comes in many forms, but we usually do not recognize this until disaster hits.\n\tJonah was an impetuous man given a very difficult task: travel hundreds of miles to the great city of Nineveh, denounce it, and tell the people that they must repent. Try to imagine this one: you must go to Baghdad today and do the same, alone.\n\tTarshish is conveniently about as far from Nineveh as a man could go, and Jonah, thinking understandably that he might wriggle out from under an unpleasant assignment, goes in the opposite direction. His decision is costly, as most runaway decisions are; as a non-seafaring Jew, he has to make the journey by ship; and the waters of the Mediterranean are perilous. (He also has to fork over a significant amount of cash for the trip. This was no free ride.) \n\tWhen you are running away—from people, your past, your habits—things rarely go right. The storm hits, and you slip into denial as Jonah did, sneaking off into the hold for a little nap.\n\tBut God, the great Pursuer, rarely lets you off the hook. In Jonah’s case He sends a group of pagan sailors to ask him some uncomfortable questions. 'Who caused this storm to happen? What business are you in? Where are you from? Who are your people?' In other words, who are you? Jonah here is forced to confront his denial, and he sees that he is running away from God.\n\tRecently, in a dark and discouraging time in my life when I was running, I found myself walking by a marina, and glanced over to read the name written on the stern of a sailboat: 'Paracletos,' Greek for 'helper.' Jesus used this word for the Holy Spirit. Like Jonah, it was a wake-up call: Peter, do you get the message? I’m here, alongside you, even in your efforts to run from me. \n\t—Peter Moore"

We turn to God when things get desperate, and we often wait until things get desperate before we do. \n\tAnd just how desperate is Jonah’s condition when he calls to the Lord? Interpretations vary. On the optimistic reading, Jonah is merely in a tough spot, but things are basically OK. Like Geppetto and his wooden toy Pinocchio, he is sitting there on a tranquil raft inside the belly of the great whale, merely awaiting rescue. Others might grant Jonah is in great danger, but deliverance is only a prayer away. 'Call on the Lord, Jonah, and things will be fine.' This is the hopeful point of view that life is good and most distress is overstated. \n\tBut it’s quite different when you realize that Jonah is experiencing a kind of death. He is lost, utterly helpless, and beyond any possibility of rescue. Look at the cumulative images in this chapter. Water is the perpetual symbol of death in the Bible (think baptism); the whale, or 'fish' is that great monster of the deep, Leviathan (Job 41:1; Ps 104:26), a symbol of disorder and chaos. Jonah is wrapped in the undersea weeds, drowning; the bars of the land have been 'closed' to him forever; he is in the 'Pit,' 'cast out from God’s presence.' These are not symbols of 'difficulty'—these are symbols of death and dereliction. Jonah has died there in the depths, and his prayer reflects a belief that even in extremis, so to speak, God has not abandoned and will not abandon him. \n\tSo, what of you and me? Do we feel completely abandoned at times, 'dead' to all relationships, including God; caught in the web of encircling problems that are completely beyond us? \n\tSince Jonah’s story is meant to be a sign to us, take heart. God is still watching, waiting, listening. Your awareness of this truth may be clouded by the sheer magnitude of our problems. But as the hymn writer William Cowper put it, 'behind a frowning providence, He hides a smiling face.'\n\t—Peter Moore"

But Jonah is not only not pleased; he is actually angry. All along Jonah has held on to an exclusive view of God’s love. Like the old Wessex Prayer, Jonah would have prayed: 'God bless me, my wife, my two children, us four, no more!' \n\tJonah stands for all of us who believe that God’s special care and concern should be restricted to those who are demonstrably good. In this view, God has no business forgiving those who have spurned Him, pursued other things, lived on the wild side. Yet what Jonah most fears is exactly what happens.\n\tJonah is so depressed that he sees absolutely no point in living. Wouldn’t you, too, if the good guys actually don’t win in the end? So the Lord gives him a little lesson in ecology. The plant that shades his little makeshift gazebo looks great in the morning, but then wilts and dies under the hot midday sun. Filled with misplaced compassion for the plant, Jonah again lets loose with his all-too-ready anger (4:4,9).\n\tThe point of this parable—for that is one thing the book of Jonah is—boils down to one simple truth: God loves everyone, especially the unlovable. The irony of Jonah’s disappointment in God’s mercy toward the Ninevites is that he is also unlovable. Unwittingly, he is on the same level as those who he thinks are beyond God’s love. \n\tWe’d be better off to get with God’s love for the unlovable, or we’ll end up like Jonah—one of those self-righteous grouches who couldn’t, for their own sake, recognize the love of God staring them in the face. You and I are fully loved, even though we deserve His wrath. Fortunately, as with the Ninevites and Jonah, God has another plan.\n\t—Peter Moore"

It’s hard to make 'life application' segues, such as Have faith like Jonah, because Jonah doesn’t even seem to like God all that much. I was repeatedly told to be like Noah, Abraham and Moses, but the three-inch cutout of Jonah was never the icon to emulate.\n\tTo a fidgety fourth grade boy, the bearded biblical figures all looked surprisingly austere despite the fact that they were so, well, adhesive. When the teacher was not looking, it was just too easy for us to turn her Bible morals into a fabric Clash of the Titans death-match: Moses spins his ninja staff against the switchblade-wielding Abraham, while Jonah surfs the whale’s back. Noah, stuck upside down, nervously watches for cops from the sidelines.\n\tBehind this gladiatorial scene sits God, peeking over the shoulders of mischievous boys who have no idea why dead guys with Bible beards ought to matter. God smiles because He knows that boys and girls like this will one day sing the hymns, and they will also long for the days when life was as easy and fun as this ad hoc flannelgraph throwdown.\n\tMost importantly, God knows that one day they will look less like the austere heroes and more like the jaded, flesh-and-blood Jonah. One day these boys may become reluctant prophets in the middle of a tempest, in the belly of a whale, on a beach so far from the safe room of their silly childhood. God knows this about the Jonahs, too: 'What’s your problem?' God asks. 'You!' we answer, 'This whole plan of yours... the way you have taken me to this absurd place and withered this little shade tree, the thing which most reminded me of that childhood place.'

God assures him that those who have acted wickedly will reap their fruit by the hands of the Babylonians. This does not exactly 'scratch the itch' for Habakkuk because the Babylonians, he objects, are just as corrupt as the Israelites, if not more so. God eventually convinces Habakkuk that He will reveal just how short anyone’s arms are when they step into the ring against the Almighty. In response to this declaration of God’s justice, Habakkuk raises his voice in spontaneous praise: 'I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior.'\n\tWhat I find helpful about Habakkuk’s prayer is that it does not undermine the cruciform pattern of the power of weakness in the world: 'Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice...' In other words, Habakkuk calls it as he sees it: wars and injustice, economic instability, and rising divorce rates all suggest the apparent absence of a loving Creator. But God reminds the prophet that it is precisely in the midst of such decay that God chooses to show His strength. Because of this message, in the midst of all else failing, Habakkuk clings to Him. \n\tWilliam Cowper, the 18th century poet and hymnist, echoes Habakkuk’s sentiment in his hymn 'Sometimes a Light Surprises': \nThe vine, nor fig–tree neither, \nTheir wonted fruit should hear, \nThough all the fields should wither,\nNor flocks, nor herds, be there:\nYet God the same abiding,\nHis praise shall tune my voice;\nFor while in him confiding,\t\nI cannot but rejoice.\nCowper’s attitude here is even more astounding, knowing that he suffered from periods of such intense depression that he attempted to commit suicide on at least three occasions. He actually saw the world through the keyhole of the cross: this recognition of the weakness that God will resurrect into new life. \n\tYou are not the strong one. You are in the company of weak prophets with wrinkled brows and hymnists writing out of the depths. This is good company, however, because only the weak ever find the priceless power of clinging to God the Savior. \n\t—Dylan Potter"

My wife reminds me that this is what kids her age do—throw food rather than eat it—and so I grimace forgiveness, but it doesn’t come easy. Despite wanting to put limits on how often I can let her bad behavior slide, I am forced to relent. \n\tZephaniah, and really most of the prophets, do a pretty good job relaying God the Angry Father. And it’s generally for the right reasons: Israel is behaving badly, and God tells them this with specific examples. The warnings, however justified, never seem to work, though; God’s children continue to disobey, and God throws His hands up, passing over their sin once again.\n\tNothing has changed: we, too, are repeat offenders. We’ve done it enough times to know full well right from wrong, and yet knowing this doesn’t change our intent. After yet another repeated inner-judgment, another passive-aggressive comment at your spouse, another ignored call, we hear from God that 'The Lord has taken away the judgments against you' (3:15). He could judge, but He doesn’t. There’s no 'Shape up or ship out;' there’s no thin ice. It’s counterintuitive, but strangely, 'God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him' (John 3:17).

Immediately before speaking these words, the Lord—through Haggai—instructs His people to 'give careful thought to your ways' and, in a not-so-subtle way, hands us a searing description of our life’s natural inclinations.\n\tIt is a picture of fret-filled impotence. Like George Jetson, there is a sense of 'running, running, running,' for no purpose except to not fall flat: 'Get me off this crazy thing!' \n\tI wonder if Jesus had these Haggai verses in mind when he met the woman at the well (John 4). 'You will drink that water,' he said, 'but you will never have your fill. You will eat again, but you will only be hungry a few hours later'—you’ll never have enough. You will work, you will get paid, you will spend your money, and you will need to keep on working. Is this really all there is? Surely, if it is, we may as well eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die! \n\tThere’s a memorable scene towards the end of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. The main character, Yossarian, recalls a time when he was on a mission, inside a bomber in WWII; someone had called over the intercom to go help the gunner who’d been shot. The plane had taken heavy fire, and the gunner was hit in the leg, not too bad as wounds go. Even as the gunner listlessly complained that he was cold, dutifully and carefully, Yossarian had tended the wound, proud of himself for handling the situation, confidently reassuring the gunner: 'there, there; there, there.'\n\tAs he finished, he sat back to admire himself and his work. To his horror, Yossarian saw a trickle of blood coming from beneath the other’s flak jacket: upon opening it, his blood and guts—the gunner’s actual life—spilled onto the floor. He had been caring for the wrong wound; this wound was inoperable. \n\tAll Yossarian could do was hold his friend, saying again and again, 'There, there.' 'I’m cold.' 'There, there.' All Yossarian could do was run to stand still.\n\tWho among us hasn’t dealt with this impotence with the fatal wounds? And who can’t feel hope and expectancy well up from deep within when we hear that one day we will 'run and not grow weary, walk and not grow faint' (Isa 40)? Or that 'living water will one day be given, so that we will never again thirst' (John 4)? The good news of God’s invasion on our life will mean that there will be 'no more death or mourning or crying or pain' (Rev 22).\n\t—Gil Kracke"

She pointed, asking, 'What is that?' I had to explain that the Brad Pitt and George Clooney version was a remake. Well, that floored her. 'Are there any more of my favorite movies that are also remakes?' I started listing them. 'And don’t even get me started on music,' I added.\n\tIt’s sometimes easy to focus on whether things were better in the past, how things may have been smarter, simpler, or just plain happier 'back then.' Gil Scott Heron, one of the forerunners of hip-hop in 1970s and 1980s, once said something to the effect that we all want nostalgia—we want to go as far back as we can 'even if it’s only as far as last week.' However, so often this nostalgia is rooted in personal pain. When we think about our careers or our troubled relationships, it’s easy to reminisce about being happier when we were single, or in high school, or before the kids came. Yet none of this gets to the heart of the real problem, because I know I wasn’t happy when I was single, and let’s not even talk about high school.\n\tNow, there was a time when things definitely were better (roughly two chapters in Genesis), and understanding this, namely who we are as creatures after 'the Fall,' really gets to the heart of things. It’s not about how I might have been happier at some other time in my life, but rather about who I am and have been since my conception—namely a hurt, frightened, fallen being, who hides from God in my solutions to my hurt. \n\tBut I thank God that He comes to me, and to all of us, then and now and always, where we are, in our bad jobs and confusing relationships, in the days of fear and weakness. We don’t need the original temples of nostalgia (or even the original Ocean’s Eleven); while our memories deceive us, what is fundamentally true now was true then. Instead, we can take courage in this truth: God’s promise to us demonstrated on the cross of His son, Jesus Christ, who is the real temple, who has made known God’s steadfast Spirit among us. \n\t—Leonard Finn"

		"text": "On the heels of a previous declaration that the Lord alone will be the source of a fearsome and awesome salvation, the prophet continues with this thunderbolt about the 'one whom they have pierced.' \n\t 'And I will pour out a spirit of grace; And I will pour out pleas of mercy.' The Lord is speaking here: the spirit of grace and supplication is given to us—it is never natural to who we are. This givenness always prevails: the work of the Lord within me continues hour-by-hour, moment-by-moment, as I relate to Him in a fundamental position of reception. Without this grace given, my heart is hardened; my judgment remains clouded; my sense of perspective stays skewed. In short, I remain self-interested and self-absorbed.\n\t'When they look on me, on the one whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn.' This is the remarkable fruit of being given a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy. As I look on the one whom I have pierced, I am also given the right portions of gut-churning remorse and despair.\n\tWhy is this important? Because if the spirit of grace is not first given, if the Lord is not this 'first mover,' if I am not given the eyes to see—then I look on this 'one who was pierced' in an entirely different light. Naturally, I move to blame-shifting and disassociation: It wasn’t me, I had nothing to do with it. Naturally, self-justification reigns: Well, he deserved it; she got what was coming to her; they didn’t leave me any other options—I had to take care of myself and my family.\n\tThe Lord has none of this—He squares each of these directly, and directly God transfers the justice upon Himself. Pouring out grace and mercy, the Lord draws us to see our hands driving the nails of our transgressions, gives us the sobriety to deal with our part in the death. In a flood of guilt, we are yet loved, even by the one we have crucified, resulting in 'true repentance, amendment of life, and the grace and consolation of the Holy Spirit.' We can then join in declaring with fearful wonder, 'Surely this man was the Son of God!'\n\t—Gil Kracke"

		"text": "God says a messenger will come to purify and to judge, like a refiner’s fire or a launderer’s soap, all to reconcile people to Him. But the purification process does not quite come as expected. \n\tIn summers during college, I worked at youth camps: for a couple of years, a song called 'Refiner’s Fire' captured me. I loved that song. I imagined being purified, allowing the dross and deep-buried dirt within me to rise to the surface and be skimmed off the top, like a cauldron heated by the love of God. This idea resonated deeply within my newly formed faith.\n\tBut the idea of purification I had has a fatal flaw. Though there is clearly an element of truth in this process, it is not the way we are prepared for the Lord’s coming. No amount of preparation brings us to a satisfactory point. Part and parcel with my 'refiner’s fire' metaphor was the idea that elements of impurity are resting alongside the elements of silver and gold; one needs only to go through the—albeit painful and tedious—heat to distill the original elements. Implicit here is the idea that we only need the 'sins and impurities' in our life exposed, and then rooted out. \n\tBut the reality is quite different. There’s no silver and gold here: it’s all dross. As I am, there’s nothing worthy of a listing on the Periodic Table. Instead, this dross—these dregs of sin—are part of me; they are who I am (and not just what I do). To be purified means total substitution—what’s in there must die and be replaced by something entirely new.\n\tAnd here we find that same old story: it requires a death. More specifically, the death 'by whose stripes we are healed;' by Christ’s death, I am prepared for his coming. By his death, I can stand and I can endure, for by his death I am given life. \n\tHow we are prepared and purified, to be 'righteousness' acceptable to the Lord? Simply and only because there is a new cauldron thrown on the fire; God made the One who knew no sin—pure gold, nothing to be refined—to be the filth distilled, that we might be the gold instead, the righteousness of God.\n\t—Gil Kracke"

This is a bold statement, and one whose truth might not be self-evident in everyday life. Many of the daily problems we face can be fixed, or at least addressed: if our car breaks down, we can take it to the garage. If we get a headache, we can take some aspirin. If we say something mean, we can apologize, and so on. \n\tAuden’s meaning becomes clearer when we consider problems of a less everyday nature, the kind that keep us up at night. I was speaking with a friend recently who just separated from his wife. He told me, 'I’ve done everything I can think of. Even couples’ counseling hasn’t helped. She just doesn’t want me. It’s going to take a miracle to save our marriage.' He had pursued all the right options, and nothing had worked. The problem was simply beyond him. So it is with us. Our condition is not fixable. That is, we can empirically say that the solution to human nature has not been found in the realm of 'what’s possible.' Instead, we need a miracle to save us—from ourselves, from our sin, and, ultimately, from death. \n\tIt should come as no surprise that the birth of the one 'who will save his people from their sins' was full of the impossible. Mary’s pregnancy is merely the first part. Equally miraculous is the fact that Joseph actually believes what the angel tells him here. And he not only believes—he obeys. These are miracles! To explain them away or downplay their importance is to deny the extent of the Good News. \n\tIs there a situation in your life where nothing short of a miracle will help? An impossible problem or person that just won’t go away? This passage gives us permission to acknowledge that some problems are indeed too big for us. You are not imagining things—'we who must die demand a miracle.' Yet the 'glad tidings' are that Jesus is the miracle we have been waiting for, the one who saves us. The impossible problems of this life have found their impossible answer in him. \n—David Zahl"

No matter what your relationship is like with your mother and father, you can probably relate. Parents loom large in our lives and in our minds, even after they are long gone. \n\tYou don’t have to be a child psychologist to know that from the moment children are born they look to their parents not only for protection and sustenance, but love as well. They look to their mother and father to answer the fundamental questions, 'Do you love me?' and 'Am I enough?' When these questions are left unanswered, or are answered with ambivalence, people can spend the rest of their lives looking elsewhere for answers, casting for substitute fathers and mothers wherever they go. Our work, our friendships, our marriages—every project and every person become a potential oracle, or place where we might find the answer we have been looking for. Maybe you know someone who is always overreacting to perceived slights, someone with whom you walk on eggshells, knowing that even a hint of disapproval will set them off. Someone to whom every interaction feels like a test. Maybe you’ve noticed that tendency in yourself. It’s exhausting! \n\tThe passage we have here, of Jesus’ baptism, contains an unequivocal affirmation of a Son by a Father. This blessing inaugurates rather than eulogizes Jesus’ ministry. It is an approval that comes first, in other words, before the temptations in the desert, before the miracles in Galilee, before the trials in Jerusalem. Approval precedes them all. Christ did not spend his ministry trying to earn his Father’s approval. It was his from the beginning, and this is no coincidence. He was free to love others, independent of the answers they might give him. \n\tPerhaps you had wonderful parents, and if so, praise God! But even those who have grown up in supportive, loving households will find themselves asking these questions from time to time. No one’s parents are God, after all. (The Onion once produced a hilarious article entitled, 'Study Finds Every Style of Parenting Produces Disturbed, Miserable Adults.') But if your upbringing was not what you would have asked for, if the answers you received were tentative, know that God’s response to you is not. He responds to you the way He did to His own son: 'You are my beloved child, with whom I am well pleased.' His approval comes before our strivings and successes and failures, not after them. It is not contingent on performance. This is the kind of Father he is. Regardless of how you feel about yourself, and regardless of what your accomplishments say or don’t say, your Father is well pleased with you. \n\tSo where are you asking the question today? Is anyone asking you the question? Where are you looking for your answers? Today you’ve found one.\n—David Zahl"

It gives her a way of thinking that allows her to have self-esteem. Along comes a girl named Mary Grace, who insults her straight-on, telling her she’s a 'dirty warthog from hell,' and this immediately disrupts her vision of the world. Suddenly she sees a vision of heaven with all the 'freaks and lunatics' leading the procession, the last being first, the least being greatest, and herself—a 'good' woman with a grateful disposition—at the rear of the parade.\n\tWe all have a worldview that helps us to feel good about ourselves, whether we view ourselves as resting at the top of the career ladder, leading in the church, or raising high-achieving, well-behaved children. This hierarchy-love has been called a 'theology of glory,' a term that describes our attraction to believing things—about ourselves and the world—that elevate our position and give us clear criteria for self-justification. Paradoxically, in O’Connor’s story, it is only when Ruby is insulted and brought low that she has any true religious experience at all. \n\tIn the devil’s temptation of Jesus, we see two worldviews at work, competing for Christ’s affections. The first is the world of glory—where Christ can produce food, power, faith, and rulership—and the second is the world of the weak, where he will experience hunger, captivity, powerlessness, and death. Throughout the Bible God chooses the weak and lowly to be His vessels, and here we see God himself choosing the way of weakness, suffering, rejection, and condemnation, not only to favor the weak, but to be the weak.\n\tEssayist John Jeremiah Sullivan says that Christ’s 'breakthrough was the aestheticization of weakness. Not in what conquers, not in glory, but in what’s fragile and what suffers.'13F It’s impossible, as inveterate achievers, to find this paradoxical beauty of weakness for ourselves. But we can say that the beautiful aspect of Christ’s love for weakness is simply the weakness itself. Pain and suffering are not beautiful, except for the potential, unique to weakness, to be loved undeservedly. Jesus chooses weakness and becomes weakness, going so far as to 'become sin,' because it is in this poverty that grace arrives (2 Cor 5:21). It is only in Christ’s choice of weakness that weakness itself is made lovely.\n—Will McDavid"

This something has created a poverty of spirit which is both the hallmark of, and the necessary condition for, the work of the Spirit in our lives. \n\tNext comes the mourning—mourning ourselves and the world—then humility (Jesus calls it meekness), born of God’s undeserved goodness; hunger for the righteousness which only God can give; mercifulness born of God’s mercy on us; then purity, then peace and, finally, the willingness to suffer like God suffered.\n\tIn reading through the Beatitudes, one notices that the 'reward' of the first is the same as the last: 'for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' What this tells us is that there is really no such thing as a 'law of progression' in the Christian life, and that sinners and martyrs are really the same, because our reward is the same. It has been secured not on the basis of what we have done or will do, but on the merits of Jesus’ death and resurrection. \n\tChristianity is a faith in which we do nothing and God does everything. He is the one who humbles, who restores, and who brings forth fruit, often in the same breath. He brings us to our knees and gives us the strength to withstand persecution.

All of us want to avoid it as much as possible, and when we can’t avoid it, we try what we can to minimize its side effects. As Christians, we get nervous admitting the depth of our pain, because what if it is a sign of a lack of trust in the goodness of God, a lack of faith?\n\tI was listening to a friend tell me about her life in recent months. She had moved across the country after living happily in the South for many years. As I listened to her, it was clear to me that she was on the verge of tears from the change, but every time the tears came to the surface, she would say, 'but I know I have so much to be thankful for, and I know God loves me, and that is all that matters.' No tears allowed.\n\tI don’t believe in telling people what to do, but if I did, I would have said to my sad, exhausted friend, 'What you need is a good cry. You have lost so much. Of course, there are also good things about your move, but you will not be able to see those clearly until you mourn the losses. Cry until you cannot cry any more. And, for God’s sake, don’t think your tears are a sign of faithlessness or ingratitude. Did not Jesus himself say, ‘Blessed are they that mourn?’'\n\tWhen pain is denied or kept at bay, the sufferer misses out on the opportunity that comes with facing pain honestly, which is feeling the weight and powerlessness of it. Counterintuitively, the experience of going into the pain generally brings out compassion, peace, and even joy on the other side. \n\tLike the day we call Good Friday, our deaths (no matter how small) can be transformed—resurrected—such that we might even call them good.

The lenient, merciful response would be to let it go. \n\tBut as any of us who have been in a relationship know, mercy is easier said than done. We find ourselves bringing the bothersome behavior up, even when we know that doing so has never helped in the past, that it has only ever produced conflict and hurt. This may be a trivial example, but the feelings at work are not. It is not surprising that so many relationships that are born in love end in bitterness, where one or both parties feel scrutinized and trapped. \n\tBrian Wilson of The Beach Boys sings, 'Love and mercy is what you need tonight.' That is, we don’t need to be made more aware of our alienating traits—that just produces more alienation. We need to be shown mercy.

'Blessed are the merciful.' \n\tWhat then for those of us who can’t seem to keep our mouths shut? Those of us who have acted mercilessly towards the ones we love? While the quid pro quo mercy exchange may be true of our relational lives, fortunately God doesn’t operate on this continuum. On the cross, Jesus suffered the full mercilessness of God (and humanity) that we deserve, so that we might be shown the opposite.

Later in the film, after a brutal day in court, as Ted boards an elevator Joanna tries to apologize to him for her lawyer raking him over the coals during the custody hearings, but he looks at her and says nothing, and the door closes. Although Joanna wins the custody battle, she decides Billy would be better off with Ted, and, in the final scene of the film, Joanna boards an elevator as she goes to tell Billy goodbye. She has been crying, and her makeup is running, and she asks Ted, 'How do I look?' Ted smiles and replies, 'Terrific.' The elevator door closes and the credits roll. The film never shows Ted and Joanna riding an elevator together. There is no reconciliation.\n\tOften our relationships lack reconciliation, and this lack creates feelings that ricochet between hidden resentment and open hostility. It’s not the way it’s supposed to be but it’s the way it is. We live in a world where marriages end in divorce, grown children refuse to see their aging parents, and best friends become inexplicably estranged. This lack of reconciliation feels to a relationship like a looming cloud hanging overhead, a potential storm held in suspension. Sometimes all it takes is an apology or a statement of guilt, but this is all but impossible to rouse. As Philip Roth says it in American Pastoral, \nYou fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick... and yet you never fail to get them wrong.14F\nApparently Jesus considers reconciliation more important than worship: 'leave your gift there at the altar and go,' he says, 'first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.' The good news is that we have been reconciled to God, and therefore we can be reconciled with others. Our reconciliation to others seems to come in response to being reconciled to God through the death of Jesus on the cross. As Paul writes, '(God has) reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation' (2 Cor 5:18). \n\tWhat about you today? Perhaps there are people in your life with whom God is calling you to be reconciled, or perhaps you’ve already tried to be reconciled but it just won’t happen. The good news is that it’s not up to you; in Jesus’ death on the cross, you have already been reconciled to God, fully. The burden has been lifted and the black cloud has vanished. \n—David Johnson"

		"text": "With the current state of sexuality in the West, there is no way to avoid the issues raised by Jesus in this passage. Sex is everywhere, and yet most of the Church is unwilling to talk about it honestly. Instead, we have found it easier to close our eyes and point our fingers, making sure 'pure Christians' don’t stray from the path. \n\tWe have chosen to deal with modern sexuality in a misleading way, with abstinence programs peddling 'save yourself for marriage' slogans, while not having a sure scope of what 'saving yourself' entails. We hold rallies for kids in their sexual prime and promote purity, as if kids had ever been 'pure.' Alienating those we perceive to be sexual deviants, we have made scapegoats of cohabitating 20-somethings, all the while conveniently overlooking the married or single churchgoers with less apparent sexual backgrounds and hang-ups.\n\tWhat Jesus says in this passage condemns us all. While we finger point and blame shift, Jesus says the only direction a finger rightly points is toward the self. I am the lustful one, I am an adulterer, I have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\n\tI remember youth functions that talked about sex and the inevitable question was, 'How far is too far?' Every single leader had a different right answer, as did I. 'Am I still a virgin?' It seems like that depends on whom you ask. Whatever the answer is, the point is this: the boundary becomes a misleading badge of honor when you toe the line, and a self-destructive shame when you cross it. \n\tGod loves you. Jesus gave his life that you might live. There is no such thing as a 'pure' Christian. There are only Christians. By calling ourselves this, we identify with a crucified outcast who has given all that we might not have shame. Human sexuality is broadly broken, but it is also beautiful and God-given. It is difficult to reconcile these two realities, except to say this: you are forgiven for everything you’ve ever done or thought or believed. Go and live your life trusting that the Spirit will guide and protect you, for on account of Jesus it is holy and acceptable to God. \n—Kris McInnes"

		"text": "One of the Biblical words translated 'sin' is actually an archery term meaning 'to have missed the mark or target.' It reminds me of the Disney cartoon version of Robin Hood, with Robin as the cunning fox and the Sheriff of Nottingham as a big ugly wolf. In the movie there is an archery contest in which the winner would get a chance to meet the lovely maiden Marion. The Sheriff wants to win so badly that he has one of his vulture goons hide inside the target so that, if his shot should be off, if he should sin, the goon can move the target so that the arrow hits the bulls-eye.\n\tWe of course play the same game as the Sheriff, trying to move the target closer to have a greater chance of hitting it. This happens when we make excuses, when we pity ourselves or blame others. This is foolish thinking: it assumes that we are the target setters, the game changers. Jesus, not you or I, sets the target very plainly here, and it is no game. The target is to 'be perfect, as our heavenly Father is perfect.'\n\tWe may try casuistry, as the Pharisees in the Bible often do, to maneuver this goal. We may say it’s all about being a good steward with our money, or not swearing, or not physically killing anyone, or not binge drinking, or paying our taxes, or helping out at the shelter on Thanksgiving, or not looking at pornography, or not starving ourselves, or calling mom and dad on weekends, or whatever. We may say it’s about something else, but it’s really this: life is about being perfect.\n\tWith this impossibly high target, sin becomes the lingua franca. We miss this mark on all counts; there is no matter of manipulation or posturing that will alter it or make it more attainable. Rather, it is a state of being. We have no way to change our state, our being, but that is exactly what must happen. You therefore must be perfect.\n\tWhere do you stand hopeless today? Where do you most often feel the pressure to hit the mark? Or maybe more appropriately, where don’t you? There is no hope for sinners like us when the stakes are this high, at least not from within. \n—Sean Norris"

For years during my youth, I thought this passage referred to some strange tithing ritual, where you planned to somehow forget which hand had actually deposited cash in the offering plate. If you did this correctly, then God, seeing fulfillment of His tithing prescription, would make the money expand. Understanding this, I believed I was topping off my heavenly 401K every week, and God was matching my righteousness with His heavenly bonuses. \n\tStill, the absurdity of 'right' giving is no less absurd to me now. Christ is describing an impossible act, one in which I fail miserably. The only way I can truly give to the needy and not announce my offering with acclamation is if I am completely taken out of the equation. This is a gift, to be able to give away something because I don’t believe it is mine, because I don’t feel entitled to it. It is a gift of the Holy Spirit to believe I am merely the vessel of the gifts God’s given.\n\tThe good news of Jesus Christ is this gift from without, in which I am taken out of the equation. No longer must I fret upon 'right' giving in hopes of gaining God’s favor—God has already rewarded me through the justifying gift of his Son. Oddly enough, this one gift of grace has a peculiar way of inspiring giving of its own. \n—Jeremy Coleman"

Whether it’s deciding the right microbrew or just the right record to 'make the moment,' or the right next-step-two-year-career towards intentional living, this friend has a tendency to construct illustrious plans for a life in total congruence with what he envisions will 'complete a picture.' Of course, it’s not surprising that these plans tend to bounce back a bit, to pick up and move on at almost predictable intervals. It’s extremely easy to mock this perspective from an objective standpoint, but it also sounds really, really good when the things envisioned seem so perfect. \n\tAnd yet they’re not. Nothing’s perfect, and I should have guessed this as I rode in the car with this friend, newly returned a bearded locavore from his latest overseas, return-to-simplicity, slow-food, socially just excursion. I should have guessed, but at the time I was just as enamored of his narrative as he had been before he left. And yet he told me it was actually pretty miserable, and he wondered if he wholly regretted having gone. He said it didn’t add up. The image he had created had no room for the imperfections that eventually rotted it away. The ideal just ended up feeling hollow.\n\tI could relate. I had recently been looking forward to a trip to London for months, to finally have that time to write those poems I had been longing to write, in that coffee shop with that perfect cup, of course. And there I sat, in that coffee shop with that latte and that perfect pen and paper, and my back sweating and somewhere it smelled like gas. And I realized I had no poem, but merely a shell, and I began to feel really sad.\n\tWho doesn’t look back ten years and think to themselves, 'I was a complete idiot! Why did I ever think calling her back was a good idea?', or 'Why did I take that job? I was so much happier before.' And yet we somehow believe that the idealistic constructions within the mind we have now are safe from anything similar happening ten years down the road. Somehow we still believe that we know what we need best. \n\tThankfully, the Gospel message here bluntly says we’re wrong. The good news here is that we actually don’t know what’s best, and that this ignorance is actually right and good and peace-giving. It’s best not to put a lot of stock in our own ideas for what will fulfill us, because all our treasures will eventually be eaten up in the moths and rust of human reality. What we can bank on, though, is the gracious supply of our loving Lord, who meets our silly plans where we are and moves us beyond them in ways we cannot see or hope for, and yet strangely, unknowingly long for. Laying up our treasures in heaven means depending upon a loving God who, by the cross, will not leave us. This allows our hearts to rest in what’s always been in control anyways—and therein find peace.\n—Ethan Richardson"

And what it says about us is not something we want to hear, which is quite a shock, given that we thought we were trying to help someone else.\n\tJesus reads this desire to help as revealing a three-fold problem. First, we have a plank—a much, much bigger item than a speck of sawdust—in our own eye; second, that we are unable to see clearly because of this plank; and, third, we are hypocrites.\n\tJesus turns it back on the help-giver, making it clear that the help-giver is the one who needs help. Have you ever pictured this scene and wondered how one is able to see clearly enough to remove a plank in their own eye? Is he not saying, 'You are the one who really needs help. There is no way you can ever see clearly enough to remove your own plank without help from someone else.' Jesus even calls the help-giver a hypocrite, which is a serious accusation. \n\tIt is interesting that Jesus does not qualify this scenario with a 'sometimes’ or 'perhaps.' He is saying that if people want to be helpful, they must first understand that they are hypocrites, self-righteous do-gooders who do not even know themselves.\n\tWhere does this leave us? First, confessing that our spotting the speck in our brother’s eye is a clue that we are not seeing ourselves as the self-righteous people we are. Second, we are the ones needing help. We need help seeing and removing these huge planks, and we cannot do that on our own. We need help knowing ourselves truly. We need help from outside ourselves, and we need it now.\n\t—Mary Zahl"

First, we somehow believe we have the ability to influence the Almighty God if we want something badly enough. Not exactly humility on our part.\n\tBut the second problem is much more serious, and the main misconception here is that we deep down believe that God is miserly, not willing or desiring to give us the good gifts Jesus refers to in this verse. We do not believe He is for us, but rather wants only to 'teach us a lesson' through some sort of tough love. We honestly believe He will give us a serpent if we ask for a fish.\n\tAsking according to the will of the Father requires stepping back from this scene whenever we hear ourselves saying or implying 'please, please, please.' In stepping back, we ask God to give us His view of the situation we are praying about. Often, our prayer changes immediately to 'Thank you, Father. Thank you that you desire to heal, to provide, to give good gifts.'\n\tSometimes a strong 'theology of the cross' leads us to think that God can only work through the bad times and the suffering. True, he is at work in the sub contrario, the places of suffering where we don’t expect Him to be.

Let him attempt to force the process, and he may spoil both fruit and tree. But let him patiently wait, and the ripe pear falls at length into his lap.'\n\tQuaint as it may be, I feel like this relates much more to what Jesus is really talking about. If the standard is perfection, and we all fail equally, then how can anyone be a 'fruit inspector'? \n\tI once listened to a preacher talk about how profoundly passive a metaphor the fruit tree was. Think about it: a tree has no input on where it’s planted, where it grows, or even what kind of fruit it produces. It’s completely at the mercy of external forces as to whether it even produces fruit to begin with. A tree has no say in the matter. It simply must be what it is.\n\tThis is oddly comforting. God is working out His plan in, through, and all around us. It’s often difficult, but I know I can trust that. Passivity is the key to activity.

Honestly, what makes you happier than coming home at night to watch someone else dodge poison darts? Anyway, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has a very poignant illustration for us as we consider this reading from Matthew.\n\tJones and a bunch of other people (Nazis included) are searching for the Holy Grail. They end up in a cave with a lot of different chalices to choose from. The Nazi guy chooses first and he chooses the beautiful, ornate chalice meant for a king. All of the sudden, you see him melt like rubber, and an ancient knight says, 'He chose... poorly.' Indiana Jones is up next, and he gives it a lot of thought. He chooses the most earthen and common cup he could find, and he chooses wisely.\n\tThe first idea—the Nazi’s choosing of a kingly cup—is the idea of straight-line power. This is a portrayal of Jesus the Regal, who brings historic deliverance for his people and deals wrath to his foes. This is what all Jews in Jesus’ day were looking for, perhaps including John the Baptist. Not that you can blame them at all—but here sits John, in prison-cell squalor, alone and at the total mercy of a captor who hates him. And as the rodents scurry beneath the bars of his cell, you can surely imagine his own certainty about who Jesus is scurrying, too. So, he sends some of his disciples to ask Jesus if he is the one John thinks he is. If not, should they expect another?\n\tThe second idea—the common cup of Indiana’s choosing—is the hidden God, who reveals himself in suffering. You can see it in verse 25 of this chapter, too: Jesus thanks the Father that He has hidden himself from the typical halls of power, and has instead chosen to reveal himself in the places power ignores. In other words, God is not revealing himself in glorious revolution or social upheaval, or any other demonstrative form of power. God is revealing himself as the suffering servant; as the one everyone turns away from. He is hiding himself so well, in fact, that it even eludes the prophet. \n\tThis hiddenness is where we meet Him. It is the lostness and lastness in all of us that meets God, without having to hide or run. Strangely enough, God in this place is much more powerful than power ever could be.\n—David Browder"

At first, the entire family cares for him; then, it’s just his sister; finally no one’s around and he dies of starvation. It is a tragic story, but Kafka’s observation is important: as long as we are productive, we are valuable. As soon as we are unable to produce, however, we lose our value. We die, so to speak. Kafka, in my opinion, is lamenting this.\n\tSome questions that may arise: Am I just a pawn in society? Am I loved apart from what I produce? Am I replaceable or not? Am I valuable apart from creating my own value? \n\tSpeaking with a psychologist friend of mine, I learned that children of alcoholics have an uncanny ability to self-destruct throughout their lives. I guess I had seen it, but never made the connection. Addicts themselves tend to self-destruct, too. I have known divorced people who have slept round-the-clock for two years straight from grief. Have these sufferers lost their value? To the outside world, to their families and friends, maybe they have. \n\tI personally remember a conversation with a past boss of mine that was along these lines. I had made a mistake, and he came into my office. He said to me, 'I want you to know that I totally support you...' (sigh of relief) '... as long as you produce.' I felt like my chest was caving in. It occurred to me that this is life; life is quid pro quo. All the time. Your worth is directly correlated to the quality of your output.\n\tBut, for all the production and its costs, we see in this passage a Man making home among the impotent.

Are there not possible 'mitigating factors,' things to be avoided, possibilities that could cause the whole plan to go pear-shaped? \n\tThe people in the parable come to the master with the intention of doing the thing that people always want to do in these situations. They want permission to try to weed out the bad in order to protect the good. They want to enlist caller ID, alternate routes, good strategies, careful seating charts, pest control, and the like—all in an attempt to disentangle the good from the bad. They want the good without any bad, and they’re pretty sure they can make it happen if they’re given the chance.\n\tJesus is quick to point out the fallacy in this train of thought: 'While you are pulling the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them.' In other words, we’re not all that great at distinguishing between the good and the bad. We get it wrong all the time. Like a friend of mine who had a crush on a girl who wasn’t interested in him: while he was preoccupied with trying to get things rolling romantically, another girl entered the scene. He could barely see her. That is, until Girl #1 made it clear that she was not interested in him. When that happened, to his good fortune, Girl #2 turned out to be great for him, and today they are happily married. \n\tGod is the only one who knows what is actually good and what is actually bad. We do not. Given this insight, His word for us, while still a bit odd, makes sense: 'Let both grow together until the harvest.'\n\tToday we are reminded that God knows best, and that we do not and cannot have full access to that information.

		"text": "Here we have two very distinct parables with two very distinct messages: the 'Treasure in the Field' and the 'Pearl of Great Price.' Let’s start by getting our actors straight. In the first parable, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, and you and I are the man. In the second parable the kingdom of heaven is like the merchant, and you and I are the pearl. The simple observation that the kingdom of heaven is said to be like the merchant, not like the pearl, ends up being very significant, as you will see.\n\tAfter years of thinking and writing about it, I am more convinced than ever that the message of the parable of the treasure hidden in the field is critical for us. It is because there was a treasure that the man sacrifices all. It is from joy that he sells all that he has. It is from a great and a true desire that he acts. The Gospel is not simply doctrinal correctness or sound theology—it is a great treasure, and once we perceive its surpassing value hidden in the scrubby field of the church, it engages our desire powerfully. We drop our self-justification projects with joy, because we have found a treasure of much greater worth. We are released from all care and worry, and we have become impossibly and eternally rich and taken care of. Of all the people on earth, we have found our way and have obtained our fortune—we are spiritual gazillionaires.\n\tI am even more convinced that the message of the Pearl of Great Value is critical for us. The heart of the message of the Gospel is that God truly wants us. He is greedy and jealous for us. He has sold all that He had, to obtain us:\nIn this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. (1 John 4:10-11, NASB)\nWhy do we call Christ’s death on the cross the 'Passion?' I haven’t researched it at all and I have no idea why we call it that. But I know what passion means—it means extreme desire, reckless love, fierce devotion to the point of obsession. It means laser-like focus born of strong wanting. How does this word relate to Jesus’ death on the cross?\nHis love for us is an absolutely reckless and dangerous love. It is abandon-everything-else desire. It is the pearl merchant selling all he had to get that one perfect pearl. It is passion for us that led to such sacrifice. He wanted us. Badly. Enough to do this.\n\tGod is love. Not just any love. Not just idle affection. Not the gentle, detached love of a grandmother. That is a wonderful kind of love, but it is not this love. His is a passionate, reckless, die-for-you love. His is a throw-away-every-other-option love. We are His obsession. We are not His obligation, we are His joy (Heb 12:2). This is the God who is love—the God who would go to such shocking lengths on our behalf.\n\tBeloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. Amen.\n—Jim McNeely III"

Similarly, the 'Feeding of the Five Thousand,' easily considered to be one of Jesus’ greatest hits, is the only passage to be reissued in all four gospels, which suggests it deserves to be read again and again. \n\tAmong many things, the story shows the power of God as well as the abundance of His loving provision for people. What has recently caught my attention about this passage, however, lies at the beginning of the story when Jesus first encounters the crowd.\n\tAfter hearing that his friend John the Baptist has been beheaded, Jesus withdraws by boat to a solitary place. Whether they understand Jesus’ state of mourning or not, a growing crowd of people can’t help but follow him from the shore. He’s probably in no state to answer to an assembly of sick and needy—and hungry—people. What is equally surprising is that Jesus doesn’t soak in his celebrity. As an aspiring musician, this kind of crowd would seem to me like an opportunity. Yet attention never seems to be on Jesus’ wish list.\n\tIt would have been reasonable for Jesus to avoid the crowd to lament alone, and it would have also been reasonable for a man of Jesus’ popularity to wave to the crowd, toss along a few catchphrases, kiss some babies and then retire to solitude. But Jesus seeks neither. Instead, he has compassion on these people and heals their sick, his 'compassion' working to show that Jesus isn’t acting out of piety or moral duty, but out of a true desire to alleviate suffering. \n\tI am convinced that based on the power within them, no one else would act in such a way. In times of great vulnerability, our human nature compels us to seek comfort; Jesus, instead, refuses to play the victim. Ultimately, this story points ahead to the crucifixion—where Christ, who deserved to be let alone, gave himself up, and died on the cross that we could be fed and healed.\n—Sam Bush"

		"text": "The Pharisees have faulted Jesus and his disciples for being too lax with ritual purity. Jesus and his friends ate with unwashed hands. Strike one. And they ate with lawbreakers. Strike two. In response, Jesus points out two things.\n\tFirst, sin is an internal problem. The things that make us unclean, Jesus says, are hard-wired into us. Sin bursts forth from our hearts, fully grown like Athena from Zeus’ head. We see the evidence of this everywhere: parents know they never had to teach their children to lie. You know you never faced a moment in your young adulthood where you had to decide whether to be a self-interested person or not. It seemed you just were. \n\tThe second thing Jesus points out is that outside-in approaches to sin management don’t work. You see, the Pharisees tried to establish moral purity by method, by focusing on external actions. The modern-day analogy is to Christians who try to maintain purity by monitoring their intake (or their children’s intake) of cultural matter: 'Don’t watch this type of movie. Don’t listen to that kind of music.'\n\tThe mistaken assumption with this approach is that there is some pre-existent pure state of being, that can then be corrupted by watching Wedding Crashers or listening to deathcore metal. Certainly what we read, watch, or hear has some influence, but only so far as it stirs up everything that was already there. Indeed, one might say that we seek out 'bad influences' based on our built-in sin. Human violence, aggression, and self-destructive impulses did not begin with the advent of Hollywood or video games. Since Eden, people have hungered after evil. As Article IX of the Anglican Church’s Articles of Religion says, '...man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit.'\n\tThis leaves us in a bad way. I wish the Pharisees were right, that all we had to do was wash our hands the right way, or just listen to Christian music, or only watch ABC Family. But as good as these things are, we find we don’t even scratch the surface of our deep predisposition to seek our own good over others, to 'follow the devices and desires of our own hearts,' as the Anglican confessional prayer goes.\n\tWhat, then, should we do? The Apostle Paul knew the answer. We are helpless. We can do nothing. But God has done everything. Paul says it twice in Romans 5: 'while we were still sinners...' In the midst of our broken lives and corrupted hearts, Jesus comes to us. And he knows our problem is not unclean hands, but unclean hearts, hearts we cannot change. So he removes the stain, and he washes us clean. \n—Aaron Zimmerman"

		"text": "Jesus describes the two realities of human existence (and ultimately there are only two): trust in yourself and suffer eternal loss, or trust in God and gain eternal life. In these potent, descriptive verses, Jesus calls a thing what it is. 'For whoever would save his life will lose it.' Trusting in yourself, worshipping yourself, saving and securing your own life may very well gain you the trappings of success in this world. But in all cases, without exception, it will lead to your own destruction.\n \tThe inevitable end of trusting yourself is illustrated in the Roman version of the Narcissus myth. One day while hunting, the handsome and thirsty Narcissus bends down to drink from a stream. He sees his own reflection and falls in love with it. As he bends down to kiss the image in the water, it seems to run away. Narcissus is heartbroken; he grows thirstier and thirstier, but he will not drink for fear of damaging his own beautiful image. He eventually dies of thirst and self-love, staring at his own reflection.\n\tBob Dylan, commenting on Narcissus, sings, 'Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool /And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled.' Narcissus may be thrilled and fulfilled as he gazes into his ephemeral reflection, but in the end, he dies because he loves his image at the expense of himself.\n\t'But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.' Trusting in Jesus may very well lead to physical death in this world and will always lead to death of your own petty and narcissistic hopes and dreams and ambitions. This is what Jesus means when he tells us to take up our cross and follow him. Following him can mean nothing else but death to self. \n\tBut death to self is a good thing, isn’t it? Death to all that is greedy and addicted and lustful and jealous and sardonic. Do you really want to go on living with those hateful monkeys on your back? Do you really like the incessant chatter in your ear and their pointed nails in your back? \n\tThere is pain involved in the removal of the monkeys, because there is always pain in death. And yet, there is also your new life. Trusting in Jesus means trusting in the one who has taken the monkeys with their teeth and claws off your back and placed them on his own. He has taken them to the cross to die with him.\n\tWhen the day is finally done, trusting in Jesus, in the words of Flannery O’Connor, means, 'the life you save may be your own.'\n—Paul Walker"

		"text": "Forgiveness is hard, and the forgiveness God demands is impossible. Jesus tells a story of a man who was forgiven much and then refused to forgive one who owed him little. This unforgiving man was tortured until he paid back all he owed, an amount so staggering that it would have been impossible for him to recover. \n\tWe often assume the point of the parable is simple, that we should forgive others and not hold grudges, but that end is impossible to attain. If we walk away from the parable thinking that this is something we can live up to, or worse, something we are living up to, then we are lost. The parable can only help us if through it we hear what we are supposed to do and realize that we are not doing it. And this should come naturally—it won’t take long to think about how unforgiving we are: think about the last time you heard someone sing the national anthem, the last time you watched Access Hollywood, the last time you sized someone up in the grocery store, the latest gossip you heard. \n\tThese are our shortcomings before the Law of Forgiveness. We may like that Jesus forgives, we may even like the idea of forgiving others, but we cannot do it ourselves. Like any other, this law can only assist us in illuminating our death before it and our need for an external forgiver. Thankfully, on the other side of this death is the new life in a forgiving and loving God, who sent his son Jesus to show us how it’s done. \n\tFrom the cross Jesus says, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,' and that is exactly what God does. He doesn’t even wait for us to ask. Before we go looking for it or even realize we need help, we are forgiven. Before our mouths can even form the words 'I’m sorry,' we are forgiven.\n—Kris McInnes"

Today, it’s not just that we have our Judge Judy and Law & Order courtroom obsessions—we also just love the narrative of justice served. This is Quentin Tarantino’s shtick (Kill Bill and, more recently, Django Unchained), and this is why his movies are so critically successful. They playfully enter into a long line of comeuppances and vengeance stories that people have loved since their dawn-of-time inception. \n\tMore than just the retributive brand of justice—of bad guys getting what’s coming to them—we are also fascinated with the restorative form. Politicians, policy-makers, and administrators all use words like 'social justice' and 'the common good' and 'equality' to talk about defending the defenseless and bringing up the lowly. This is a very good and true thing—the Bible itself speaks highly of advocacy for the poor. \n\tBut it seems that we only want this kind of advocacy for others so long as it is expressed in terms of 'deserving.' One of the most glaring examples of this is the feel-good era of reality television, like Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. We’ve all seen it: Ty Pennington yells aloud, 'Move that bus!' and a disadvantaged family is captured, mouths agape, before their brand new house, their excessively nice cars, their new full-size basketball court. For a moment, it feels like the cosmos has been generously righted, but in truth, this kind of generosity is only warranted for the 'right' kind of poor. These programs—and people in general—are comfortable with generosity only as a leg up for the hardworking, stand-up variety of unfortunates. Generosity for us does not mean blind 'handouts,' but trustworthy 'investments' with reimbursements. (I wonder how long these shows would last if the same generosity landed upon chronic gamblers, crooks, and sexual deviants?) \n\tThis is what Jesus is saying about the human brand of justice in relation to God’s. As Feist sang, 'There’s A Limit to Your Love.' The kind of deep generosity we may accept for ourselves runs counter to the deep judgment we hope others get. This parable gives a new—and too-often revolting—take on equality: everyone gets this generosity, without repayment plans, starting with those who deserve it least. \n—Ethan Richardson"

It marks the enthusiastic reception by a large crowd of pilgrims who will, in five days, completely melt away, with the remaining 'welcomers' shouting 'Crucify him!' In short, it depicts a symbolic action that is both true and false: he is the King, and he is also the 'Quasimodo' King of Carnival. He is past and present—the prophets foretold this but not in the way it was going to go. Mighty and frail—he doesn’t look like the only person who could ever get to Easter, yet he is definitely thermonuclear!\n\tThe inward and the outward senses of this ironic situation are captured perfectly in the old hymn for Palm Sunday that is called 'Ride on! Ride on in majesty!' It was written in 1827 by Henry Hart Milman. The stunning words of Milman’s hymn reach their climax in the four lines of verse five:\nRide on! ride on in majesty!\nIn lowly pomp ride on to die;\nBow thy meek head to mortal pain,\nThen take, O God, thy power and reign.\nAn odd and curious truth of Christianity is that in the places of anguish within the human drama—within our individual dramas of intense pain—that is where God almost always does His 'best work.' How strange to say! And how strange still, after 40 years of seeing it and thinking about it, it still seems. It is true to experience, though. \n\tAt the same time, whenever something painful comes up, I still want to look elsewhere for my hope. 'I haven’t got time for the pain,' as Carly Simon sang, and that’s not a joke. I absolutely do not wish to make time for the pain.\n\tI naturally want anything but God in the pain.

Go therefore into the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness.

It’s as if no one on the guest list accepted the invitation to a royal wedding because they had other things to do, so instead, hundreds of Joe Schmoes are brought in off the street, to eat their veal and drink their 1978 Montrachet. \n\tStories like this give us a chance, because suddenly invitations aren’t addressed to the 'haves' and withheld from the 'have-nots.' Jesus works this way on principle, not just rubbing elbows with the fancy people who sleep well at night with a lot of money and a clean conscience. Jesus heads for the streets, where people fear being found out, or don’t know how it’s going to turn out, or wonder if they’d even recognize success if it ever came their way. In short, the Gospel is for us—we’re the ones who end up attending the wedding feast.\n\tThe next thing Jesus says is a little harder to understand: What’s all this about wearing a wedding robe, and the outer darkness? \n\tRobes are significant symbols in the Bible. Today, robes go with slippers. Then, robes went with sacrifice. Samuel wore a robe when an animal was slaughtered during the annual sacrifice to God. Priests wore robes when making sacrifices on behalf of their people. Even Joseph’s robe of many colors ends up drenched in blood as his brothers pretend that he’s been murdered. This imagery is most poignant in Revelation, when Jesus’ robe is dipped in his own blood (Rev 19). This association of robes with blood would have been well known to those listening to Jesus, and to the readers of Matthew’s Gospel, who would then surmise Jesus’ point: The wedding robe in this parable carries the blood of his own sacrifice. \n\tJesus seems to be saying that in order to attend this Hollywood wedding, you need the right get-up, and it can’t be just any Italian Brioni from Clooney’s closet. For this party you must be clothed in the blood of Christ, which is really just a redundancy, because there’s no party without it.

		"text": "One of the most memorable scenes in the entire Star Wars canon is when Darth Vader becomes Anakin Skywalker again in Return of the Jedi as he exposes his true identity under that ominous mask. 'Luke, help me take this mask off,' he says to his son. A concerned Luke responds, 'But you’ll die.' Darth Vader then says, 'Nothing can stop that now. Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.' For most of his life Anakin has been viewing the world and presenting himself to the world through a pretense. His dark, cold mask makes him look stronger than he really is since underneath is a fragile and sad old man in desperate need of unabashed love.\n\tSomething similar happens in Matthew’s passage about paying taxes to Caesar. The connection is not obvious at first, but an important thing to recognize in this story—and in life in general—is that what one sees in a situation is never all that is really happening. There is always very much more going on below the surface, just as there was with Darth Vader. Through their cunning deceit and indirect communication, the Pharisees and the Herodians inadvertently make some accurate statements about God. Namely, that God is truthful, does not care about anyone’s opinion, and is not swayed by appearances. As a matter of fact, Jesus (that is, God) is so perceptive that he sees right through their lying façade, cutting to the heart of the matter beyond the proverbial tip o’ the iceberg, leaving his surprised audience dumbfounded.\n\tWe are so often like the Pharisees—and Darth Vader—when we approach God in prayer and meditation. We can easily put Him to the test with our metal-black masks on, so long as we need not present our true selves and concerns. The irony is that God, in His infinite awareness, knows the whole truth about us—even better than we do. Strange as it is, such news is of great comfort. We can be utterly vulnerable with God in a way that we can with no one else. There is no need to sew fig leaves together, making flimsy coverings to hide ourselves from his presence. He is not swayed by our false appearance. Perhaps it is to die a death like Anakin when we reluctantly remove our masks, but we gain new life by finally being truly known.\n\tTherefore, let us render our Vader masks to Caesar, and give to God what is God’s—that is, nothing short of our entire, true, and unmasked selves.\n—Matthew C.

These passages were read to assure the people before communion that the message of the Gospel was one of forgiveness—forgiveness for the fact that we do not love God with everything, which is manifest in our failure to love our neighbors as ourselves.\n\tForgiveness—this is the comforting word of the Gospel. This is the unique form of love that comes from God through Christ and flows out to the world through forgiven sinners. This type of love—love which is grounded in the forgiveness of God—is the type that brings us back cyclically to this same Gospel message. It is this self-perpetuating forgiveness that mends fractured relationships, inspires heroic acts of selfless enterprise, and ignites the freedom of the imagination.\n \tSo as we hear the injunction to 'love God and love your neighbor,' know that our love for God flows from a response to the love that God has freely given and the reconciliation that we have with Him through Christ.

		"text": "A common reading of this parable is that God, like the Elf on the Shelf, is keeping track of your good works and will settle scores with you one day. This reading may be gussied up a bit, and might say that God gives different gifts in His grace, and so not everyone is working under the same set of expectations, but the expectations are there anyway, so really the message is the same: 'God has invested in you, so do the best with what you’ve got.' \n\tI don’t think this is what the Parable of the Talents is after. First of all, God the Landowner gives different amounts of money to each servant—five talents, two talents, and one talent—and this is not to favor one servant over another, but to demonstrate that he isn’t interested in the numbers game. Like the Parable of the Sower (Matt 13), God demonstrates His kingdom by sowing seed everywhere, wildly, without concern to production. When God the Landowner returns, those who have traded and added to their talents receive precisely the same welcome: 'Well done, good and faithful servant...' Even though one servant brings back a much heavier dividend, he gets no better acceptance than the one who brought back less than half of his. There is no staggered rewards system here—it seems more important to the Landowner that the servants play the game than bring back a surplus. \n\tIf this is the case, then what about Mr. One Talent? Why was he punished? The Landowner is not so much angry that he hasn’t come back with 'growth,' but much more upset that Mr. One Talent is all wrong about who the Landowner actually is, namely, a risk-taker and a free-bird. Had Mr. One Talent believed this—and not that the Landowner was a conniving scrooge—he would have felt free to play with his Boss’ money and take some risks, too. This belief in God the Landowner as a penny-pinching bookkeeper makes more penny-pinching bookkeepers, who wrap up their gifts in little decorative napkins and bury them below the ground. Maybe you know some of them. \n\tIt’s interesting that, in this story, those who believe God is gracious and risky take the risks themselves—and both servants come back with double. Maybe that means that, of its own, the Gospel message is self-rejuvenating. So long as it isn’t hidden, it does all the work on its own. \n\tAlso, could this be what Martin Luther means by 'Sin boldly,' that the freedom of God’s Gospel makes us wild, or turns us into hip-shooting gamblers, rather than prudent lawyers? Could it be that God here is reminding us, in faith, to dirty up the pant legs and take some risks? \n—Ethan Richardson"

In Cross-Shattered Christ, theologian Stanley Hauerwas explains that those who have suffered, who live in the aftermath of Auschwitz or 9/11, are those who seem to quickly identify with this verse: 'We do so because we think we have some idea about what it means to be forsaken...' But he continues:\nThat we can even begin to entertain such thoughts is but an indication of our refusal, indeed our inability, to believe that this One who hangs on this obscure and humiliating cross is God... This is not a cry of general dereliction; it is the cry of the long-expected Messiah, sacrificed in our stead and thus becoming the end of sacrifice (60-61).\nIt is the profundity of these words—of God hanging humiliated—that force us to the most abstract flights of speculation, because there really is no appropriate way to 'read, mark and inwardly digest' what is being related here. The intricacies and complexities of any theological tradition save people from needing to think about Jesus abandoned on the cross by God. Theological concepts like the deus absconditus (the hidden God), or God working sub contrario (under the guise of His opposite), or literary allusions (Psalm 22), may be helpful to read about, but ultimately they all stop short of articulating this—the death of God’s son for the redemption of His people.\n\tIn light of this, we do what the church has been doing for 2000 years: 'we proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes again.' We talk about the Man 'delivered up for our transgressions and raised for our justification' (Rom 4:25). In these last words of Jesus, we do find some comfort, but not in analogies or paradigms or paradoxes, but in our own sufferings and deaths. When we fear or question or cry out, we know that we are not the first, and we are not alone. In fact, as Hauerwas says it, these times are reminders that 'the Son of God has taken our place, become for us the abandonment our sin produces, so that we may live confident that the world has been redeemed by this cross.'\n—Jady Koch"

If you want to satisfy the New-Agey 'search for the divine,' you can gather crystals, crosses, stars, and vortexes, all in one gift shop. \n\tMany of us seek God—maybe that’s why you are reading this book. In this verse, we see the veil in the temple, which was a giant, thick curtain that separated the holiness of God from the people, torn in two, from top to bottom. Often this verse is interpreted to mean that now, post-Jesus, we can go find God. \n\tHowever, the truth is, as Paul articulates in Romans 3, no one really goes out looking for God. In our search for the divine, as Sedona attests, we always just turn God into what we think God should be. The importance of the veil being torn in two from top to bottom is not that we can now go to God; instead, it is that God’s Spirit is not confined to a tent or temple, and that our search for God is over, because He is now with us everywhere. He is with us now because of the perfect work of God the Son, Jesus Christ. Our search is over, and let’s face it, we were never really searching for Him in the first place—by God’s grace and mercy, tearing the veil in the temple in two, from top to bottom, God has found us and revealed himself to us in His son Jesus Christ. \n—Jacob Smith"

		"text": "This is the account of the first Easter morning. However, on this Easter morning there is no linen, and there are no brass instruments, no baked hams or Easter eggs, and no large lilac hats. Instead, the initial tone of the first Easter morning is one of hopelessness and great loss. Surely we can call upon moments defined by those two themes: maybe it was a job loss, the death of a loved one, a romantic split; it may be a season of depression or plans gone sour. Maybe you’re in one of these seasons now. Here we find a tremendous amount of hope in the midst of bleak situations. \n\tJesus and the angel appear to these two women, and what they say is important. They do not say, 'Hey! Buck up! We’re winners!' They do not rebuke their despair, but reassure them, 'Do not be afraid.' This is profound—often we believe that our despair is faithlessness, and that faithlessness means God must be angry with us. While we may feel faithless, Jesus tells us not to fear—he has triumphed over the faithless despair that defines our world. \n\tI have wondered what I would have done had I been Jesus coming out of the tomb. I probably would have come back for vengeance: 'Ladies, tell those disciples, my so-called friends, I am bringing the heat; after I deal with Rome, and those penny-pinching Pharisees, I am coming to put the hammer down.' Praise God, I am not Jesus, and there is no hammer. Jesus still calls them brothers, and he tells them to meet him at Galilee, where it all started. What a relief that, sometimes, in the midst of sadness and great loss, as opposed to just moving on, it is best to go back to the beginning, whether it be in relationships, careers, or faith. Christianity is a religion of going back to the Galilee of our lives, where we can be continually refreshed by the grace of God, and we can be reminded again and again that we need not be afraid.\n—Jacob Smith"

Unfortunately, this has had consequences, and Christianity for many of us has come down to: 'Just tell me what I have to do... Tell me the habits I must form in order to maintain my relationship with God.' We can run on spiritual disciplines for a while, but there’s eventually a breakdown between what it was meant for and what it has become. \n\tThat’s why Jesus’ words are so comforting. \n\tThe rhythm of the Christian life really has nothing to do with behavioral management or 'Christian disciplines' or 'spiritual formation.' Jesus simply tells us this: repent and believe the gospel. This is the work and the rhythm of the Christian life. \n\tRepentance really just means being honest about who you are. It means admitting there is a giant bedrock of self-centeredness that you can do nothing about. It means being aware of the fact that you’re really pretty into yourself, and you need help if anything’s going to change.\n\tTo believe the Gospel means to believe that help has arrived, that Jesus really is who he says he is and really did what he said he did. This is all we must believe: that, because of Jesus, you are loved and accepted by God, right now, as you are, and not as you should be. Rather than a repeated work through your week, we instead repeatedly return to a work that’s already been done on our behalf. Now there’s a Christian routine we can stick with!\n—Curt Benham"

When we are brought to an honest confrontation with what’s really going on in our lives—usually by way of collision course—the circumstances have the potential to send us in a beeline to God. \n\tIn most of the healings in Mark’s Gospel, the character behaves in the same pattern: he or she approaches Jesus, kneels before him, and begs to be healed. The sick and the lame are already at the end of reality’s rope, already painfully aware of their disease and their need for help. They all seem to run without a doubt to Jesus’ feet. Where does this faith come from? \n\tThis faith is not gathered with courage or zeal, but desperation; the sick have the unfiltered advantage of having reality faced for them, and so reality itself propels them toward saving help. \n\tOn the other hand, throughout the Gospels, the 'teachers of the Law' do not cry to Jesus for healing because they believe the Law has made them good. But Jesus reminds them—and us—that this kind of self-satisfaction and religious posturing shrouds the reality of our lives (Matt 23:27). The Law of God has not made us better, but has instead shown us how sick we really are. When life makes this clear—that we, too, are sick men and women—reality propels us to the faith of the sick and the lame. \n\tWhat about you? Where does reality seem to be evading you? Where does it feel hardest to be honest in life? Though it may sound dreadful now, in time, reality will go there, too, and God will come with it.\n—Alex Large"

Perhaps you struggle with it. \n\tHollywood certainly has a time with Jesus-talk: there’s Ricky Bobby Jesus, Buddy Jesus, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Passion Jesus, The Life of Brian Jesus, Jesus of Montreal. My all-time favorite Jesus, though, is from The Big Lebowski, whose purple, rhinestone-studded bowling suit and no-mess attitude make a convincing case for divinity.\n \tIt makes sense that we can often stomach humorous (even profane) images of Jesus, while being uncomfortable speaking about the real one. It might be that the real one is seen as outdated or irrelevant, or it might be the opposite—that the true Jesus means confronting a very real and very relevant someone whom we cannot contain or control. \n\tIn the calming of the sea, Mark seems to be talking about the human need for control and Christ’s trustworthy power in its absence. Both the Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions connect the sea with danger and chaos, making this miracle quite a statement: Jesus is the God of Genesis, who speaks light into darkness and brings order to the deep waters. And this is the foundation upon which the disciples can trust that Jesus—in being God—is ultimately in control.\n\tOf course, we tend to be like the disciples in the boat, accusing Jesus of being careless or impotent or aloof. We’re as likely to make these accusations when reading the front page of the paper as we are when being cut off on the freeway. We glad-hand God when we’re trying to cover our bases and shake our fists at him when we feel that He isn’t noticing us. \n\tJesus, in control, wakes and calms the storm. He knows how fickle our faith is and acts even when we refuse to believe he can. He says: 'Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?

We naturally dissociate the troubles in our lives by drawing them off to external causes. This is what people mean when they talk about something being a ‘bad influence.’ We often say that movies or music or the ‘wrong crowd’ is the problem, but Jesus says that these things don’t make someone 'unclean.' \n\tThis presents more problems down the road. Because we think the problem is external, we tend to think that the solution is external as well. This explains the popularity of diets, the new motorcycles of middle-aged men, the search for the most fulfilling job. In light of the problems of our lives, we try to change the externals of our life in hopes that the deeper things might change. \n\tBut Jesus says that the problems of our life come from the corruption of our hearts. Out of the heart come the hurtful comments that destroy relationships with children. Out of the heart comes the insensitivity to the obvious needs of others. Out of the heart comes the reluctance to answer an email from an estranged friend. \n\tIf the problem lies internally within our hearts, the question is: what can change the heart? The heart is changed through being loved.

I really wish I could hear it for the first time again. \n\tI feel the same way about the 'Jesus dying' thing. Having grown up in a Christian environment, at times it seems impossible to hear the Gospel with fresh ears. It doesn’t sound so absurd that 'the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected... that he must be killed and after three days rise again.' The story of Jesus’ death and resurrection is all too familiar for me, but it’s safe to say that back then, no one saw it coming.\n\tJesus talks very plainly about his death, yet Peter won’t have any of it. The idea of God’s Son being scorned, rejected and crucified is too outlandish to accept. And who can blame Peter? At this time Jesus has healed the sick, performed miracles, and given groundbreaking sermons, and so is earning a great deal of celebrity. In this position, influential figures rise to power—no one, especially at the pinnacle of a career, gives it up. \n\tWith 2000 years to theologize and theorize about Jesus, one might assume that the more familiar we become with the story, the more we develop as Christians. And yet nothing about the world has changed. Although the Gospel does manage to powerfully enter our lives, we are still unable to fully grasp its message. A friend of mine describes the state of the Western church as such: 'It’s as if we have been vaccinated with a mild case of Christianity, which has protected us from catching the real disease.' We can’t help but delegate the Gospel to grocery store 'muzak.'  \n\tThank God the Gospel does not require our belief or conviction in order for it to be true. Unbelievable as it may be, Christ’s death and resurrection happened, and God’s abounding grace and forgiveness are real. \n—Sam Bush"

		"text": "What kindly pastoral interpreters of the Transfiguration of Christ usually want to say is that it’s God’s Word from the cloud, His extraordinary word of attestation directed to Jesus should be heard as the divine reassurance that we today, like Christ on the Mount, are beloved children, accent on the 'beloved.'\n\tLet’s start with the plain meaning and see where we go from there. God says that this man is His beloved Son. He also says that people should listen to this man on account of that fact.\n\tI think it is a miracle that God calls anyone 'beloved.' Given the labyrinth of human nature’s mixed motivations and unconscious self-deceptions, it’s a miracle that anyone partaking of our condition could qualify for this, well, compliment. So we can start there: We all 'need a miracle everyday' (Grateful Dead), and here we’ve got one!\n\tIt’s like that wondrous 'but' in the Anglican 'Prayer of Humble Access': 'We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy...' Without the 'but,' without the operational existence of a God of mercy, our unworthiness would prove completely fatal, both now and at whatever awaits us at the point of death.\n\tAll one’s unworthiness gets interrupted at the Transfiguration of Christ, as it did also at his Baptism (Mark 1:11). We only need to add that the sheer existence of such a person, Christ, certified in his compliment from the cloud, makes the same compliment—'This is my beloved son'—a possibility for a person in conscious, humbled flight from the system of this world. The philosopher and mystic Gerald Heard wrote that 'escapism' is not a bad thing, because 'the verb to escape is clear enough—it means to leave a position which has become impossible.'\n\tI think we almost all know instinctively, and certainly on the basis of our suffering, that 'we gotta get out of this place' (The Animals). God’s Word to His Son, on the Mount of Transfiguration, makes that a possibility. Just for it to be a possibility is a miracle of miracles.\n—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "For Jesus to heal his son, a father must simply believe, but he cannot. And because the father has too little faith, it would at first seem his son cannot be healed. We are often told the same in church: if you just have faith, if you just call upon the Lord, then salvation is yours; sanctification is yours. And yet, what do you make of the stories of countless people who can’t kick their addictions, who can’t seem to love their spouses or children, who can’t even get out of bed in the morning? It seems they are suffering from a lack of belief in the loving God, the redeeming God—if they believed, things would be different, right? \n\tThis passage contains both good news and bad, and its downside is that no one, no one, is ever fully faithful or fully believing. We cannot summon this, no matter how much we intellectually defend Christ or how much we talk about him. When brought, like the man in this story, to the place of our own impossibility in even believing—let alone doing—we’re forced to cry out, along with the best of Biblical wisdom, 'what is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted' (Eccl 1:15). The life or death of his son depends on his belief, and still the father is forced to admit inadequacy: 'I believe, help my unbelief!' \n\tThe place of impossibility, however, is the place of grace. God is always our rescuer, and crying out in a state of helplessness is—paradoxically—the most authentic act of faith that’s possible in the here and now. The man’s belief doesn’t come from strength, but weakness, and faith in God amidst weakness ('Help!') is really the only Christian act of faith. The challenge isn’t to develop perfect faith; our only task is to recognize how far from belief we really are, and even this vision of desperation is a gift from God.\n\tAnd so the father in this story has true faith, which lives only in the depths of his realization that he is faithless and utterly dependent upon God. It is true for us, too, that in the place of weakness and desperation, we’re given the kind of faith that can exist alongside our continuing frustration with our faithlessness.\n—Will McDavid"

He admits to keeping most of the commandments, at which point Jesus stops him, looks at him, loves him, and tells him to sell all of his possessions, give the money to the poor, and then to follow him. The young man goes away 'sorrowful.' Why?\n\tThe very thing he thinks he can offer Jesus, Jesus tells him to give away. Jesus finds the bruise—and also, ironically, the accomplishment—in this man’s life, and he pushes on it. He does it because the man is not in a place where he can receive the Good News. He has it all—he is wealthy, upstanding, dignified—and these vast resources he feels he can use to benefit the cause, to benefit Jesus. But Jesus doesn’t want these. \n\tIf you were Jesus, and you were calling for a team of followers, it would be hard to imagine this rich young man wouldn’t be a frontrunner, right? Jesus does not pick those, though—he has no interest in who the world believes has wisdom, wealth, or wit. He instead chooses those God likes to use: 'the foolish things of the world,' which bring shame to the wise. \n\tWhat about you today? What offerings do you hold onto tightly? Or what offerings are being taken from you? \n\tTo Jesus you bring nothing to the table. You cannot serve Jesus on your own terms, deciding which gifts will prove most effective.

My favorite chapter in this book is called 'Get Over Yourself—Everyone Else Has,' which describes the dangers of being self-absorbed and self-centered—the dangers of what we call narcissism.\n\tExtreme narcissism is known as 'Narcissistic Personality Disorder.' Listen to how the Mayo Clinic describes this and see if it rings any bells:\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder is a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for admiration. They believe that they’re superior to others and have little regard for other people’s feelings. But behind this mask of ultra-confidence lies a fragile self-esteem, vulnerable to the slightest criticism... Narcissistic personality disorder crosses the border of healthy confidence and self-esteem into thinking so highly of yourself that you put yourself on a pedestal.\nNarcissism does a lot of damage. It shatters personal lives, torpedoes relationships and marriages, estranges parents and children, and wreaks havoc in church. Narcissism can take down companies, split great rock ‘n’ roll bands, and keep talented sports teams from winning. The narcissism of others has caused damage in my life, and my own narcissism has caused damage in others’ lives. I suspect it’s the same with you.\n\tJames and John, after hearing again that Jesus will die, say, 'Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.' Their response to Jesus’ prediction of his impending death and resurrection is a request for power, dripping with narcissism. Jesus responds by letting James and John know that they are clueless: 'You do not know what you are asking.' Then he asks them a question: 'Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?' In their hubris James and John reply, 'We are able.'\n\tJesus then calls all the disciples together and cuts to the chase when it comes to narcissism: 'Whoever wishes to become great among you must be a servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.' In other words, the antidote to narcissism is death. \n\tDr. Karl Menninger, a famous psychiatrist, was once asked, 'What would you advise a person to do if he felt a nervous breakdown coming on?' Menninger replied, 'Find someone in need, and do something to help that person... generous people are rarely mentally ill people' (Failing Forward 102-103). The antidote to narcissism is death to self, yet can’t we even become prideful about how much we help others? While helping others and being generous can take the edge off, it does not address the root of our narcissism, original sin. \n\tThankfully, Jesus doesn’t stop there. After telling his disciples, 'whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all,' Jesus points to the cross: 'For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.'\n—Dave Johnson"

Either the deceiver has done a very good job imitating the real thing; or the deceived forgets the real thing, or had never really known the real thing at all, and so he can’t tell the difference when the trick comes on. A great example of the first is conniving Jacob, wrapped in wool like his hairy brother Esau, to steal Esau’s blessing from Isaac (Gen 27). He must have been convincing, but then again, that story has a little bit of the second way, too: after all, Jacob’s ruse never would’ve panned out had Isaac been able to tell the two apart. Isaac’s blindness was key in his own subversion. \n\tMore people than can be counted have and will continue to take on 'messianic' deceptions of the most epic proportions. It’s a safe bet: political heads and activists, mystics and celebrities and popular designers have always created a miraculous and watchful stir. Today, with online communities like Pinterest and Twitter, casual messiahs gain 'followers' in minutes with opportune tweets or tags.

Usually, preachers use it to point out how we, the congregation, are not living up to it, and then they exhort us to get on it, quickly. This assumes continuity between the commission and the heart: Jesus tells us to do it, so we do it. What’s more, we want to. However, in this passage the disciples are discontinuous. Here are Jesus’ closest companions, he’s about to give them his final speech, according to Mark, and he scolds them like teenagers! \n\tThey are discontinuous, and so am I.

Somewhat surprisingly, I imagine, the old man takes the baby into his arms and prophesies. Perhaps it was originally as we find it, in the form of poetry, or song. Or perhaps the message was later worked into a song as early Christians found that what Simeon had said echoed some of their own deepest thoughts about Jesus. Either way, Luke gives us one of the most touching 'canticles’ in the Bible, and three tensions in the story that are worth pondering. \n\tThe first is the tension between holding on and letting go. As Simeon draws the baby close to him he, at the same time, releases himself to God. He senses that once he has seen the 'hope of Israel,' that is the Messiah, he can let go of life and 'depart' this world peacefully (2:29). Simeon might have laid his hands on the child, or simply spoken a blessing. But he takes him up in his arms, signifying a heart that grasps hold of Jesus. At this very moment, he is able to surrender control of his own destiny. We naturally do the opposite: grasp hold of our destinies and, in so doing, let go of Jesus. \n\tThe second tension is that between a merely parochial faith and a truly universal one. Simeon’s deepest desire is for 'the consolation of Israel' (2:25). Correspondingly, we are told in this postmodern age that we can have a personal faith, or be part of our own 'faith community,' but we are not to foist our religion on others. However, Simeon’s gaze extends far beyond his own people. This salvation is 'in the presence of all peoples,' and is for both Gentile and Jew (2:31-32). I wonder if those who first heard this knew the ramifications of this global vision. They, like we, must have been locked in their own little world. \n\tThirdly, there is a tension between the glory that Jesus will bring to his people (2:32), and the pain he will bring at the same time (2:35), and no one will experience this inner tug-of-war as deeply as Mary herself. I can imagine Simeon giving her a knowing glance as he speaks this prophetic word: 'a sword will pierce through your own soul also.' But the simple fact is that Jesus was, and will always be, controversial. Having him in our life will always bring both 'agony' and 'ecstasy.' \n—Peter Moore"

He said to the paralyzed man, 'I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.' Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.

And because Jesus can do this miracle of healing—something we tend to believe is more miraculous—we’re meant to understand from the account that the man’s sins have, in fact, also been forgiven.\n\tOn May 28, 2009, I was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma, a non-cancerous brain tumor that had destroyed my pituitary and ruined my health. It was hard going at first, coming to grips with the fact that my life would never again be normal. But in my suffering I was reminded of this story of Jesus and the paralytic, and as I wrestled with my situation I began to see the story in a fresh new way. \n\tThe normal way to read the story, that we can believe that Jesus can forgive sins because he proves he can heal, was turned on its head for me, because I already believed that in Jesus I was given forgiveness. And so the story spoke to me in a new, inverted way, meaning that because he has forgiven my sins—and I knew that to be very real—I could rest assured that, if he so willed, he could heal my body. \n\tAnd so I have held on to this in faith for two years now, and it has brought me great comfort in both hope and despair.

		"text": "Whole books have been written about this wonderful passage, but I would like to say just three things. First of all, it’s clear who she is—she’s a prostitute. She has costly perfume because she’s a working girl, and she’s slept with a lot of men. Everybody knows who she is, and so she’s got no hope of ever being any different in anyone’s eyes; her history precludes that. Luke only states what is true: she’s a prostitute, and it doesn’t look like she’ll be changing careers any time soon. \n\tI’d also suggest that this is a story focused on upending what we think repentance looks like. We like the moralistic repentance, the brand we initiate, first by working up a very sincere heart and then by developing a new game plan for how things will change, and then—we think, we hope—God’s love and forgiveness is renewed. Instead, Luke illustrates here a woman bound in an inescapable identity. She cannot change, but then she hears a word from outside. She hears about a man who will love her absolutely and unconditionally—even her. She is overwhelmed. Her heart is broken open. It is then that she can repent, because she has been forgiven first.\n\tBut what does this repentance mean? Well of course, it must mean that she is no longer plying the trade, right? She’s joined the Young Ladies Christian League, or gotten out of town and started over, right? Well, if that happens, there’s nothing of it in Luke 7. No, Luke shows what real repentance is: contrition and a broken heart. To repent is to simply despair of your self and fall at the feet of Jesus. To repent is to be sorrowful for what you are, not to have a game plan for improving what you do. To repent is to lay everything at his feet and kiss them.\n\tAnd the last thing I want to say is that this passage is written for me and you. It was written for me because I am both Simon and the woman. It was written for me, the respectable, church-going sneerer. It is also written for me because there is something about me, inside me, just like the woman, something that I can’t change and know everyone would hate me for. I won’t tell you what it is, but it’s real.\n\tMay this true story break open our stony hearts today.\n—John Stamper"

'Which one are you?' Of course, the right answer is the Samaritan. And maybe that’s true sometimes—maybe we have, at some time or another, found ourselves walking in the sandals in each of the three. However, upon closer inspection, what seems more fundamentally accurate is that we are none of them, but the man in the ditch. \n\tWe are the dying man in the ditch who waits for rescue. The Priest passes us by. The religious man, the one who preaches to sinners, walks on by. The Levite, the lawman, the do-gooder, walks on by. But it is the Samaritan, who stands as the opposite, an outcast and a nobody, who shows compassion and mercy to a Jew who ought to have nothing to do with him.\n\tThe first two may have had good excuses as to why they didn’t stop. The Priest, if he touched us, might be made unclean and then couldn’t do his priestly duties. The Levite may have been too busy, may have been worried it was a trap. But the scoundrel stopped and helped. \n\tThis is the story of the Christian. We find ourselves in the ditch in need of rescue, but the world and its moral fixtures will not save us.

No matter if I was actually innocent or caught red-handed, I always tried to play the victim-of-certain-circumstances card, full of reasons that I was actually innocent.\n\tLike the man talking to Jesus in this passage, we all scramble to justify ourselves. Nothing displays this more than how readily we justify our withheld love. When confronted with co-workers, friends, siblings, 'neighbors' in all senses of the word, we tell ourselves that we’ve done the best we can. There’s the litany of qualifiers: She’s just impossible to deal with. He’s had his chance. Honestly, who could deal with the most annoying habit imaginable? At all dead ends, we find ourselves insisting, 'It’s not my fault.' \n\tIsn’t it true that we want to absolve ourselves from the responsibility to love beyond convenience? By saying, 'Not my fault,' we escape the guilt that accompanies our most self-absorbed conveniences. \n\tJesus’ response to this attitude is a parable about mercy. The unequivocal command, 'go and do likewise,' insists that loving our neighbors is more mercy than we can handle. Jesus knows full well how miserably we fail to love as we ought, describing the human heart as 'a source of evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness,' just to name a few (Mark 7:21). His demand reveals the chasm: that we—in our failure to love and our desperate defensiveness of that failure—are the ones in need of mercy, in need of forgiveness. \n\tThe good news is that there’s no more justifying ourselves before God. No more lists of reasons or acrobatic excuses. We can just be who we are, as it is said in Titus: 'But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy... so that being justified by His grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life' (3:4-7). \n—Liza Koch"

Tell her then to help me.' But the Lord answered her, 'Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.'",
		"text": "I love Martha, specifically here in this moment—it is such a human moment. This isn’t to say that Mary—in her stillness before Jesus—isn’t human; she just represents a human with the 'the good portion,' loving God with all her mind, heart, and soul. But what I love about Martha is that she needs to be brought out of herself, out of all her delusions of control. She is so anxious about everything that she must call out, and I can relate: it seems to me that without first going through what Martha is experiencing, we do not get to the position Mary is in. We cannot recognize the good unless we are called out and brought to it, and there is no better starting place than the place we’re in now, which for Martha is issuing her complaint of resentment. She trusts Jesus will do something with it. \n\tAnd Jesus does do something, but not in the way Martha expects. Rather than command Mary to help her sister, Jesus calls Martha over. He lovingly addresses Martha—overextended, frustrated Martha—and her preoccupation with many things. He tells her he knows she’s overwhelmed, '...but one thing is necessary' (10:42a). Oddly, Jesus is preaching himself; he is the good portion, and he’s right there with her. He illuminates her anxiety (even heightens her awareness of it), but notice he does not chastise her for it, and he gives her what she needs—himself. There’s no chiding, no 'Chill out! Stop being so anxious, Martha, it’s not attractive!'\n\tThis is one of the fundamental differences between the Law and the Gospel: the Law is static, the Gospel is dynamic. The Law can point out your anxiety, but it cannot get you to calm down. It just stands there, it cannot beckon nor plea nor cause you to hear; it can only leave you in static judgment. The Gospel moves, taking the hearer and moving her, walking her to itself. The Gospel seizes the anxious one from her tangled priorities and brings her the good portion, the only necessary thing. This is the same thing as being brought to the Gospel of Jesus, to the foot of the cross. \n\tYou and I have more of the story than Martha does. Though this is a foretaste of redemption, we know it points ahead to Jesus’ death and resurrection, which happened for the justification of all the anxious ones (Rom 4:25). We are justified by faith apart from our busyness and our work—this is Christ’s good news. The gospel message tells us that we are neither defined by our failures nor successes. This is why we need to continually hear this message, continually be reminded of it. In hearing, we are given freedom from our anxiety. We are not told 'don’t be anxious'—it’s not up to us to quell our anxieties—but the justification of the anxious, under God’s control, does it for us. We are called like Martha and hear, in the midst of our anxiety, to then respond like Mary.\n—Lauren R.E. Larkin"

		"text": "I feel like it’s important to focus on this word 'impudence' in this passage, because this passage can be read in a wholly different, even opposing way if that word is misinterpreted. Other translations have 'persistence' which is equally tricky. Either way, this is undoubtedly a parable about prayer. It seems plausible to me, and I’ve actually believed this before, that the passage could be saying we can ask enough times or sound desperate enough when we pray, or gesture or genuflect in a way so as to convince the Lord to get out of bed to come to our aid—I don’t think it’s saying this, though. \n\tThe passage instead seems to be offering an answer to a different question; it’s not so much 'How do I pray?' or 'What happens when I pray?,' but instead, 'Why does our Good Friend come to the door to help us?' This seems to be the pertinent question. Not if but why does he? Why does he get up with his children slumbering beside him—he’ll surely wake them up!—to help the one at the door? Why does he get up for the one at the door, who should have called beforehand? The audacity of this visitor! Why, when the world says, 'Why didn’t you get the job done?' When the world says, 'Shop Closed'? When the world says, 'Okay, I’ll help you out this time,' sighs and, in the heavy strain of piety, remarks how he just got these loaves today. Why does the friend get up? \n\tIt’s the impudence. The self-evident need of the figure at the doorway. The problem is so big that the improper indecencies of 'asking for something' or 'calling after suppertime' or 'waking up the neighbors' or 'waking up the children' or 'making a scene' are thrown out the window. This is desperation. There’s nowhere else to go—this is all there is—the only hope. This is audacity! The friend in bed knows this is a big deal, there’s no other reason to be coming by this late, and so he arises. \n\tA friend of mine recently had one of these experiences. His father was about to have his third heart operation in two weeks, and his family—a plane flight away—was understandably at wit’s end. Knowing that his family needed him there, he phoned work to let them know he needed to go. He found himself guilt-tripped, his coworkers passively remarking, 'Go, but your performance reviews will suffer due to your absence.' Arriving at the doorstep in impudence, he found himself at the cold, dark portico of the Law, hearing a numb nothing behind closed doorblinds.\n\tNow a heavier feeling of guilt overshadows his family’s need as he boards the plane—what an impossible weight! But this seems to be the way of the world, a reprimand for need, a pre-ordered form for who’s getting what. \n\tWhat does this parable then say in response? The parable, instead, gives us assurance that God is a light sleeper. Like Motel 6—'We’ll leave a light on for you'—the door is always open. Our arrival at the door in the deepest reaches of our night is evidence enough, explanation enough that we need something, and our Friend meets us there, our needs in his hands, reminding us that these weights are taken care of. With this, we can rest easy. \n—Ethan Richardson"

		"text": "When asked what God’s kingdom is like, Jesus says it is like a seed that grows into a tree, and that it is also like leaven, or yeast, that gets hidden in some flour. \n\tTwo properties come to mind. First, God is interested, and has been for some time now, in trees. Adam and Eve ate from the tree at the very beginning—the tree of knowledge. Jesus 'hung upon a tree' to bear the sins of the world (Acts 5:30). And, when it is all said and done, God’s people will live under the shade of the 'tree of life' (Rev 22:2). Now there are plenty of good theological things to say about trees: trees give protection, they bear fruit on their own, they are powered by the sun. But instead of these great qualities about trees, Jesus is more concerned with the fact that trees are planted seeds. The kingdom of God—God’s operative structure—is like a very small seed that is buried under ground, that in some way dies, and then brings forth an entirely unforeseen (and very large) purpose. \n\tWhen Jesus talks about yeast, something he quite likes to do, and its connection with God’s kingdom, he focuses on the detail of its hiddenness and its pervasiveness. Everyone knows you don’t need a whole lot of yeast to make a loaf of bread rise, but Jesus is also saying that the yeast is invisible—it is literally 'hidden in' the flour. That is to say, there’s no telling where God’s handiwork is or isn’t, until it’s already risen to the fullness of its purpose. Only then do you see that it was everywhere all along. Maybe this has something to say about only seeing things clearly in retrospect...\n\tSo have you wondered where God’s been lately? Has it felt like a dry spell? Do you feel lost? Here, in the mysteries of things buried and hidden, Jesus says this is probably evidence of God’s pervasive handiwork. \n—Ethan Richardson"

He is a desultory combination of gaunt and bloated. Um... he thinks, maybe life on Father’s farm wasn’t so bad after all.

On top of these amazing accomplishments, our protagonist, the younger brother, also managed to meet a lovely girl, his one true love, whom he married. Their two young children (a boy and a girl) are blonde and precocious. \n\tThis, the world’s story, is not the one Jesus tells famously in Luke 15. In the world’s story, willpower and success are key components. It is fair to say that the world offers basically the opposite of Jesus’ story. His narrative is much more common. The story is one of self-destruction. The people sound like actual people. You see, God’s story is inextricably enmeshed with the facts of life in a fallen world, where people are weak and prideful. God has placed his bets on the wrong horses. And, furthermore, the top-seeded older brother is mad about it!\n\tBut the father’s angle is full of surprise. It is comforting and encouraging, even in the lowest of low moments. It dresses failures in fine garments and puts rings on their fingers. And the prodigal is in no position to entertain misconceptions about the origin of such worthiness. Actual good status comes from God. Opportunity comes from God, too. The same is true of help and hope. Do you need any of these things? Or have you already gotten everything under control like an older brother? Christianity is probably not the religion for him. \n\tThe classic children’s hymn 'Jesus loves me, this I know' is a wonderful song. While its first verse is emblazoned in the minds and hearts of many, the last two verses are rarely heard. They remind us of the unceasing trajectory of the spiritual life. There is the initial encounter with a gracious Father, and then, too, there is the way it plays out for us today, perhaps some time after the fact of that initial home-coming:\nJesus loves me, loves me still,\nthough I’m very weak and ill.\nFrom his shining throne on high,\nComes to watch me where I lie.\nJesus loves me!

Could it be that the boulder is too big for us to budge, much less pull out? Could it be that our pragmatic hearts know no better than to come to the father as needy beggars looking for a better job? That’s the idea I get from the younger son.\n\t'But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!’' In other words, the younger brother’s decision is practical: 'This sucks!

But our Father does. Our Father doesn’t just sit on the bench while we are crushed by the Law—no, the Gospel is the final blow. The Father rises up when we are a long way off and runs to us and falls on our neck with a hug and a kiss. 'Come home sinner, come home,' He has been beckoning to us.

		"text": "Maybe you’ve been a Christian for a while now, and maybe you are feeling good about 'your righteousness,' like the people Jesus is talking about in this parable. Maybe there are moments in your day, or specific situations, when you catch yourself silently judging someone else. More often than not it has nothing to do with them; it’s really just that it makes us feel more righteous. \n\tIf you had met me in college, I would have told you that I had been a Christian for a while. After a significant experience when I was around 15, I began a sort of quest to really know God. My conversion was quite sudden, and I began to read whatever Christian books I could get my hands on; I was reading the Bible regularly; I was praying for long periods of time; I was generally staying on top of things. In modern Christian parlance, I was a 'good Christian.' Things calmed down in high school, but I still wasn’t compromising anything—no swearing, hooking up, getting drunk, or the like. For this reason I tended to look down at those around me that did these things and reveled in the praise it got me in its absence. It’s safe to say I felt that my sin was significantly less than everyone else’s—I was somehow better, and I felt God knew it. Maybe that’s why he saved me, I thought.\n\tBut as many of our stories go, I met a girl in college and completely fell head over heels for her. I loved her intensely, even though she wasn’t a Christian and did many of the things I felt were not Christian. Many of my friends warned me of the perils of dating this girl, especially for my faith. They told me my faith would die, that I would have to choose between her and God. And so, of course, I felt torn in two, my whole life in the balance. All the pressure plunged me into a spiral, and I found myself doing things that, in truth, I never thought myself capable. \n\tBy God’s grace, I had a friend throughout the whole experience who just listened to me and supported me; when all the pious left, he told me he trusted God was able to support me without berating me. Through this, I was able to see two things: first, that the relationship had to end—something I didn’t want to see but already knew was true. He didn’t force this on me, but let it come to me in its own time. Second, and more importantly, that I was sinful, and that Christ had died for my sins. This made me like the tax collector, beating my breast and crying out to heaven for mercy. I began to look at others and feel a new measure of compassion. \n\tWhen we read this parable in Luke, let us remember that Jesus, who saw right through the heart, told it with tenderness to those who were feeling good about their 'righteousness.' This is good news for the Pharisee in us all, that when we approach him in faith, he will humble us by opening our eyes—first to our sinfulness, and then to his indelible mercy. \n—Javier Garcia"

		"verseText": "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.",
		"text": "Jesus’ agony in the Garden of Gethsemane is the conflict in him between what he wants in his flesh to be (i.e., a surviving human person, skipping a dreaded painful death) and what he believes he is being called by God to be (i.e., a person of completely sacrificed ego for the sake of others whom he loved). This awesome conflict, because it places his core natural human desire to stay alive in direct opposition to his dedication to the call of God, causes the sweat of his body 'to become like great drops of blood.'\n\tIn Renaissance and Baroque paintings, Christ’s agony in the Garden is sometimes depicted with angels holding golden cups to catch the drops of his sweated blood. In a beautiful song entitled 'In the Garden,' Bob Dylan captures this same treasuring of what was happening there:\nWhen they came for him in the garden, did they know?...\nDid they know right then and there what that power was \tworth?\nI think the conscious decision to lay down your life for another person—to extinguish your ego with its completely alive and kicking demand to stay upright 'or I’ll blow your house down!'—is inconceivable to our human nature. We may feel it in relation to a child of ours, or to someone else we love, but that is usually a form of need-love. We’d do anything for them because they do so much for us.\n\tBut to actually vote to cancel your own ego? That, as Bela Lugosi once said in the character of an old nobleman who wished he were dead, 'would be glow-rious'. Who can do this? Who among us is actually able to step away from human nature’s cry, 'I want to live.' The doing of this, entirely not in character for human nature, would be, well, worth something.\n\tChrist sweats blood because the powerful action he was contemplating was 'worth,' in Dylan’s words, far more than anybody knew. One of the reasons I’m a Christian is because what Christ did is so beautifully beyond 'me and my house' that I desire to worship Him.\n—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "This exchange between Jesus and his disciples at an urgent and dangerous moment says more than just a 'No' to taking matters into your own hands. It says a great 'Yes' to healing, and loving, your enemy. (I resent this, by the way, about Jesus, as he always goes that extra step toward the crumb who hurt you.)\n\tThe disciples carry two swords among them, and like Ben-Hur, they are ready to give their lives in service of their teacher and friend. Peter is the one who by tradition takes instant aim at the high priest’s slave, and slices off the man’s ear. Jesus cries, Stop! Then he heals the stricken man. It’s in Mel Gibson’s The Passion, and you can still visit the actual scene, at the foot of the Mount of Olives.\n\tJesus forbids violence in his defense, and then takes that extra step. This is the rocky part. For myself, I am right with him on the passivity. We have seen and see every day what happens when you try to take matters into your own hands. The better way is to concede things, right down the line—'It’s out of my hands!' When you take things into your own hands, it always seems to backfire. Let things come to you. Let the result come to you. And if you’re in the wrong, let the result go the other way. I think all of us who embrace the iustitia passiva are with Christ here in this lightning encounter. Our theological and personal instincts run in that direction.\n\tBut there are limits, right? Do we really have to go the extra mile, and stitch up the minion who 'vuz just folloving orrderz?' \n\tThe way to look at this is not to ask whether you or I can do it, whether you or I can take that extra magnanimous step. The way to look at it is rather to remember when you or I were in the body of that temple servant, that little man in service of the wrong who was nevertheless helped along to a better path. This is that one extra step—Neil Armstrong’s one small but giant step—in service of our fellow earthlings. We are not so much 'Peter,' who needs to be instructed to put away his sword. We are 'Malchas,' which is the traditional name given to the temple slave. 'I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!' Come, Lord Christ, and help me get up. I am Malchas and my right ear is lying in a puddle of blood on the ground.\n\tThe other day I was with a depressed young man, age 29. His face was completely blank and he could barely get out a word. Turns out he is well educated, graduated from an excellent college, and has a skilled job. But he is depressed and needs help. How could I help him, as he was pretty alienating—no smile, no laugh, dead eyes, no affect of any perceptible kind? The key, for me, was relating to my own depression, my own personal history of depression. The man in my study didn’t have to know that, but my love for him was going to have to be tied to one thing: whatever identification I could effect with his disease. Thank God I could. The link was not whether I could reach out in my own strength to this affect-less person, but whether I could reach out to my own personal affect-less self. And that self exists. All I need to do is recollect one long night in Manhattan years and years ago when my wife went into a movie theater to see a movie with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep and I couldn’t even go in, but pleaded depression and just walked around the block, at least 25 times, until the movie was over, and we could go back home. Stranger to depression? No. Possibility of connection? Yes.\n\tThis is how I can make Christ’s magnanimous gesture somehow my own.\n—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "David O. Russell’s film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) is about Pat (Bradley Cooper), a husband on a restraining order, recently released from a mental institution for his (previously undetected) bipolar disorder. Pat’s story soon becomes entwined with Tiffany’s (Jennifer Lawrence), a girl with an equally checkered past, who agrees to help Pat cope with his new illness. Eager to get on the healing train so he can get his old life back, Pat at first seems incapable of doing so, mostly because he’s unwilling to face the issue himself. \n\tAnd then there’s a kind of breakthrough scene in a diner—it’s Halloween and everyone’s got costumes on around them—where Tiffany listens to him and discovers, 'You think that I’m crazier than you.' Pat can’t deny it, but later relays the conversation in his therapist’s office, that Tiffany said she 'likes [the checkered] part of herself along with all the other parts of herself, and can I say the same?' The therapist asks what his answer is, to which Pat responds, 'Is that...? You’re asking me, you’re really asking me that question? With all my crazy, sad—? Are you nuts?'\n\tIt is not nuts, and it is not until Pat can see that he is, in fact, worse off than Tiffany that he can begin to work on things. And this isn’t just true of bipolar disorders. Anyone’s desire—and ability—to disassociate themselves from the truth about themselves is a scary power. It can kill intimacy in relationships and it can prevent healing help. \n\tThis is the same dramatic conclusion made after Peter’s third denial. Peter, having rebuked Jesus for his prediction, now sees in Jesus’ knowing look what he never would have admitted, even to himself. He goes out and weeps bitterly, not just out of remorse, but probably also out of some kind of release: no longer is he constrained by the poison lie he held to so tightly. The truth is out, and it has exorcised his false pretense.\n\tI have often wondered what that look from Jesus was like. Surely Peter sees in Christ’s turning to him—at the moment of his betrayal—a terrible understanding. Surely Peter sees that, if Christ saw this coming, he must have seen everything else coming, too. And still he has not turned his face away. \n—Ethan Richardson"

		"text": "On November 14, 1940, the Nazi German air force blitzed the industrial city of Coventry in England, leaving its surviving citizens in a state of collective nervous breakdown during the days that followed. In the midst of this destruction were the roofless ruins of the city’s medieval cathedral. Shortly after the cathedral’s devastation, someone used charred timber roof beams to construct a cross to place at an altar made from the rubble. The cathedral’s Provost, Richard Howard, then had the words 'Father Forgive' engraved in the sanctuary wall behind the altar. \n\tNot only did Howard make it a point to forgive the Germans, but he intentionally wrote only 'Father Forgive,' leaving out the word 'them,' since he recognized the need for the people of England to be forgiven as well. Indeed, the Royal Air Force would later carpet bomb the German city of Dresden in similar fashion with an even higher death toll. Nevertheless, you can imagine the audacity at the time of implying that the English were complicit too!\n\tI like to tell this story of Coventry because when I talk about everyday forgiveness with respect to Christianity, people often move to the abstract with me. They might say, that’s well and good, but try forgiving a Hitler or an Osama bin Laden. C.S. Lewis, an Englishman who lived through the Second World War, wrote something very similar about forgiveness, calling it the most unpopular Christian virtue:\nEvery one says forgiveness is a lovely idea, until they have something to forgive, as we had during the war. And then, to mention the subject at all is to be greeted with howls of anger. It is not that people think this too high and difficult a virtue: it is that they think it hateful and contemptible. ‘That sort of talk makes them sick,’ they say. And half of you already want to ask me, ‘I wonder how you’d feel about forgiving the Gestapo if you were a Pole or a Jew?’\nLewis goes on to say that such questions about forgiveness are typically premature:\nWhen you start mathematics you do not begin with the calculus; you begin with simple addition. In the same way, if we really want... to learn how to forgive, perhaps we had better start with something easier than the Gestapo. One might start with forgiving one’s husband or wife, or parents or children... for something they have done or said in the last week. That will probably keep us busy for the moment.15F\nIf we’re realistic, much forgiveness is too lofty for us. It’s akin to calculus or quantum mechanics. Let’s start with some very basic arithmetic instead. Can you forgive your husband or your wife or your parents or your children for something they have done or said in very recent memory? Better yet, can you forgive yourself for the things you have done? Stop and meditate on this. \n\tAre you guilty of an infraction that haunts you? Maybe you have never been able to forgive yourself for this thing you did or said. Perhaps you find yourself to be unforgiveable.\n\t'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.' Jesus Christ—our only Mediator and Advocate—is talking about us. He is talking about the Nazis, the citizens of Coventry, our spouse, our children, our parents. He is talking about you and me. We are all there casting lots for his garments. Yet he nails it all to the charred timber beams of the cross. When we can’t even find it to forgive ourselves for these trespasses, God in Christ forgives it all at once—once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous. \n—Matthew C. Schneider"

		"text": "These simple words of Jesus to the 'good thief,' are a perfect example of how the relative silence of the Gospels forces people to 'fill in the blanks.' In this instance, we have Jesus, evidently, pronouncing salvation to this man who we know nothing about, save that he is being crucified. People have tried to blunt this picture of pure, unadulterated grace by speculating that this man, were he to have lived, may have warranted eternal life, or perhaps he was being crucified as a good political objector. The tradition has attempted to answer this question in a variety of ways, but they all end up as mere speculation, at best, because his request is all we have. \n\tA lot’s been said about this interaction, but I want to highlight the request of the thief, 'remember me,' in light of the seeming absence of God. While we can confess by faith that we trust Jesus has, in fact, remembered us, in the 'presence of God’s absence'—the experience of the Hidden God—we are often driven by fear to try and secure our own legacy, validate our own existence. \n\tWere we to have faith that Jesus will, in fact, remember us, then the fears of inconsequence, of not leaving a legacy or making a difference, would fade away. Instead, too often we baptize our careers, families, ministries or anything we can think of to hold up as something by which to be remembered. For our purposes, this is the allure of the Law, which promises that we can establish ourselves and create our own remembrance, that our lives will be monuments to who we were and what we did. As we grow in our appreciation of how unlikely it is that our monuments will be very big (or ever big enough), we’re getting close to an understanding of what Paul means by 'the curse of the Law.'\n\tThis is why we need to hear the Gospel every day, because like the 'good thief,' we can know that our request is simultaneously a confession and a prayer—remember me!—and Jesus’ answer was, and is, and is to come: 'Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.'

And they should, writes theologian Stanley Hauerwas:\n...but that the words comfort us should not hide from us that these last words of Jesus before his death name his willingness to embrace the ice-cold silence of hell...He is no Christ figure’ if by Christ-figure we mean the exemplification of a universal pattern of sacrifice for the good of others. Jesus is no ‘Christ-figure’ if we mean that his death is an exemplification of how we should all die; that is, we should die with the confidence that we have nothing to earn from death. No, this is the real and specific death of Jesus, the Savior of all that has been, is and is to come, who submits to death by our hands. (96-97)\nI find this to be a profoundly unsettling point. I would much rather theorize and systematize and turn the event of the cross into a way of explaining my life and the world around me. It’s easier to talk about, for example, 'the presence of God’s absence'—the Deus absconditus, not the cross. But I’ve realized instead that part of the attraction to the concept of the Deus absconditus, or any other theological phrase for that matter, even to the distinction between the Law and Gospel, is alluring because it sees through the cross. \n\tTalking about the Crucifix—the reality of God incarnate killed for sinners—is the same as talking about his absence, because in the everyday experience of our crucified lives we wait for and live in hope of the God who saves.\n\tAs Hauerwas points out, it is not that we suffer in solidarity with Jesus, but that our sufferings are penultimate to his, because he holds out the promise that 'this too shall pass.' Because of his sufferings, we have hope. We can hedge, ask questions, and speculate, but at the end of the day, what we have is faith in a completed work, a work of forgiveness, mercy and promised redemption.\n\tThis last word of Jesus is his acceptance, his final acquiescence and surrender to the will of his Father, into whose hands he commits his spirit. This is what we hold onto; it is what we profess. When we are crushed under the weight of our own lives, burdened by 'what we have done and what we have left undone,' we are driven to our knees and point to our only source of hope: 'the wood of the cross, on which hung the Savior of the world.' We stand with Luther, who wrote in the Heidelberg Disputation, crux sola nostra theologia—the cross alone is our theology, and with the Apostle Paul, who endeavored to only 'preach Christ and him crucified,' and we hold onto those words with passion and tenacity, 365 days a year.

We tend to devalue words. Image is everything. But this is where we can get into trouble. Words not only describe; they can also do. When the priest says 'I now pronounce you man and wife,' you are married. When the judge says 'not guilty,' you are set free. Words can do things.\n\tOne of the most powerful things a word can do is promise. An image can’t quite do that. When someone promises, 'I’ll be there for you,' they are committing themselves to that person. \n\tGod has done this in his creative word. Through his word, he creates the world. Through this word he promises to be there for the world, to watch over it and take care of it. Through his Word, he himself enters our world, ultimately to take on all its pain and violence, for the very purpose of taking it away. And creation is itself a promise. It is God’s guarantee that he will take care of you, along with all other creatures. God’s creative word always delivers a gift. Your life is a gift of God, as the lives of all others. In this gift, community is established; we are joined in fellowship with fellow believers—and indeed with all creatures. Even our disagreements can’t destroy this bond.\n\tGod’s word is a word that does what it says and says what it does. In the word that gives the risen Jesus Christ to us, God finds an ear to receive this good news. With God speaking, no other sounds can distract. And through our ears, we learn that God is true to his word. He forgives us our sins and opens us to new horizons for growth and service.\n\tAlso, God’s word is alive and efficacious.

		"text": "Receiving, believing and becoming. This verse encapsulates Christianity. While many have turned the first two stages into the science of how to get saved, I am not convinced we know what it means to become God’s child. Jesus came into the world not to run us through the how-to-get-to-heaven crucible, but instead to gather creation under two bloody wings. Another devotional writer Oswald Chambers wrote, 'In the history of the Christian church, the tendency has been to avoid being identified with the sufferings of Jesus Christ. People have sought to carry out God’s orders through a shortcut of their own. God’s way is always the way of suffering—the way of the long road home.'\n\tThis world has and always will clamor about new rights issues, and these issues may have merit, but a friend of mine likes to say, 'Christians have no rights in this world,' and I think he is correct. At least in the sequence of receiving, believing and becoming, there is no entitlement. Becoming is not code for a life of ease. It’s also not code for a re-evaluation of motives or ethics or preaching. Becoming a child of God involves much more than theological catchphrases. \n\tJesus assures us we may very well be despised by people we try to assist. With family, friends, and neighbors, there’s no reason to expect that the 'children of God,' whatever their theologies, will be welcomed any more than the Son of God was. Receiving Christ is an inheritance serving a life-and-death sentence: you are loved more than you could imagine, and you don a crown of thorns. To put it in a creedal sense, this is the essential 'descent into hell' that always precedes rising from the dead. Looking at it this way, the appeal of the evangelist becomes a call to one’s own funeral as much as it is a call to believe, and this cannot be avoided.\n\tNevertheless, this is not hopeless or bleak: it is this identification with the Man of Sorrows that makes sense out of families and jobs and getting older. Though it is difficult to walk into the fringe with our 'new birth' certificates in hand, and walk away from the Dylan Thomas adage to 'Rage, rage against the dying of the light,' we enter into the honest, but unpleasant, heritage of souls whose names pepper the pages of our Bible. Like Jesus himself, who became the outcast of Eden, who knew the rough kiss of betrayal, we are the sons and daughters of a terrible affliction and a deep resurrection. This is something of what it means to become a child of God. \n—Dylan Potter"

In reply Jesus declared, 'I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. 'How can a man be born when he is old?' Nicodemus asked.

First, he comes to Jesus by night, perhaps a bit embarrassed by his fascination with the Son of God, or embarrassed by its association with the losers of the world. \n\tMore than that, though, Nicodemus doesn’t seem to understand a word Jesus is saying! Much more interested in theological questions than the heart of the matter, Nicodemus is stuck on the mechanics of 'new birth' ('How can these things be?'). It is in the context of this discussion that we hear the famous words 'For God so loved the world,' but we never get Nicodemus’ response. After Jesus delivers these concise words of comfort, Nicodemus fades into the background, leaving only the impression of his frustrated and floundering speculation.\n\tPerhaps this first glance at Nicodemus gives us a warning about theologies in general. It’s no wonder people tend to cringe and wince when people start talking theology; it is so often disconnected from what’s really going on, and it’s often an opportunity for navel-gazing more than it is for any kind of good news. Speculative study—while having merit of its own—can be like a nighttime visit, providing more opportunities for evasion than for honesty, and this is totally Nicodemus’ state of affairs. It is sad, because what use is it knowing any of it if it doesn’t bring us to reality? What good are the questions if we never reach the love of God in Christ? \n\tThe good news is that God knows we sidestep and is infinitely patient with us in our sidestepping. What’s more, He draws us back to Him. Jesus responds to Nicodemus’ shortsighted questions with the truth. As we see Nicodemus in our thinking, how great it is that God redirects us to the heart of all theology: Jesus Christ and him crucified.\n—Javier Garcia"

The digging is easy for a while, but then, about a foot down, I hit clay and the digging becomes harder. After a while I’m completely covered in red mire, this refuse of years of decay. Then dawn breaks. The sun rises over the cruciform headstone, and its shadow passes over me. Not long after, I am completely under its shadow. I cannot escape the depths of digging, but I cannot escape the morning shadow of the cross, either. The sunlight seems to filter around the cold stone, heaven a cross-shaped keyhole through the pit that I have dug for myself. \n\tTo me, this is a more insightful vision of sanctification. The deeper we dig, the more we realize Christ’s boundless depth of love.\n—Keith Pozzuto"

We all posture in this way—sometimes we forget we’re even doing it because it has become such a part of us. \n\tAt work, in front of my boss, 'I’m okay' is to look motivated, maybe periodically make note of my 'job effectiveness' in the past months. At night, 'I’m okay' is getting exercise, dressing meticulously without looking meticulous, knowing when stop talking about myself for so long, after a couple—but not too many—bourbon-gingers. Amongst the religious-folks, 'I’m okay' is theologizing everything, using Latin terms, saying things like 'the human condition.' I have many faces. Whitman said it: 'Do I contradict myself? Very well then...I am a multitude of multitudes.' \n\tHave you ever felt a friend of yours watching you talking to another friend from another circle? Did your multiplicities become embarrassingly transparent? It is confusing, and sometimes a little scary, that our saccharine satisfaction with our relationships is often a satisfaction with how well we played the face, how well we 'pulled off' the roles of Hard-Working Employee, Witty Suitor, Self-Understanding Christian. In other words, how we say 'I’m okay' is, in a lot of cases, a testimony to what’s not okay. Where we pose most in our lives is likely where we suspect we would be rejected if we were honest. \n\tThe good news is that Jesus cuts to the chase. We may hedge and say, 'Let’s keep this ambiguous—theoretical—noncommittal.' This woman at the well is obviously someone who needs some company, being the socially ostracized woman in marital strife she is, and yet she is still playing the game. Jesus doesn’t cut to the chase to condemn, but to illuminate that he knows and still loves. He needs her to know that he sees the face behind the faces and still comes to her. Jesus, in love, renders to a pulp her fragments of pretense. And as much as we are this woman, the same is true: we are offered this grace, that behind our many faces we are cut to the heart—and fully loved there. \n—Ethan Richardson"

The sick man answered him, 'Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; and while I am making my way, someone else steps down ahead of me.'",
		"text": "Saint Augustine says that the sick man, at the edge of this pool with its 'five porches,' is symbolically sitting upon the five books of the Torah, the Jewish Law. 'These five porches signify the law which bears the sick but does not heal them, discovers them but does not cure them.' The sick man can sit there as long as he wants, but he will always be a sick man, sitting upon a standard that will always 'step down ahead of him.'\n\tIn light of this, an emphasis is put on the question that Jesus asks the sick man and the response he gives. 'Do you actually want to be made well?' Besides being an insulting thing to ask a cripple, the question itself says Jesus might not be so sure he actually does want to be made well. The sick man’s response seems to support this: he offers Jesus a non-response by laying down the victim card. Rather than say whether or not he’d like things to change, he can’t help but tell Jesus what circumstances have kept him from changing. In his very public sickness, he has developed a defensive self-pity that’s quarantined him from help. \n\tPublic or not, we tend to sidestep inquiry in the same way. When questioned, sometimes we might play the martyr, and drone on about circumstances that just made it impossible; other times we play the hero and get irritable defending the unblemished decisions we’ve made. Self-pity and vainglory are really two sides of the same coin of self-defense. They are two ways we choose to refuse the help we need. \n\tWhat’s wonderful here is that Jesus doesn’t need the right response to get on with the work of healing. He understands that sick people balk at help, and he helps anyway. \n\tSo, what questions have you been sidestepping (or completely avoiding) lately? Who or what has prompted them? Where have you felt the need to explain away an inquiry? It could be that there you sit, as the sick man, upon a hopeless or unattainable standard.

For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself;  and he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.'",
		"text": "Listen again to these words from our Gospel lesson: 'The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son... He has given him authority to execute judgment.'\n\tThe unavoidable word in these passages is judgment. It is a word that causes people to bristle, the kind of word that, when we encounter it, feels a bit like a speed bump, even a roadblock. It brings to mind a wagging finger, 'tsk tsk' sentiments, shame-shame-shame fingers. Judgment stops us in our tracks, seemingly holding us down under the giant Platonic form of a heavenly thumb.\n\tSo we need to think about what it means for Jesus to be our judge. Let me offer two thoughts. \n\tFirst, if Jesus is the one who has been given by God the authority (as God) to judge the world, then it is also means that you and I have been relieved of any similar obligations. In life, it is not our job to judge. When we find our selves doing it, when we find ourselves looking down our noses at the people we come in contact with, we have stepped out of proper alignment with God. We have, in some sense, simultaneously tried to usurp His role, and have ceased to trust Him.\n\tSecond, if Jesus is judge, this is good news. You want his judgment! His justice is full of mercy. As a theologian has said, it is fair to say that, in Christ, 'the judgment of God is forgiveness.' I don’t know about you, but that’s the last judgment I ever expect reckoned to me. It’s the one verdict that I rarely offer myself. It’s incredibly good news that, once and for all, our final judgment has come down from cosmic officials, as a deep, all-encompassing, counterintuitive, refreshing acceptance.  He has pled our case with three short words: 'Father, forgive them.' \n—John Zahl"

But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?",
		"text": "There is a very strong courtroom motif throughout the Gospel of John. At the end, John actually frames his account of Jesus’ life like a courtroom eyewitness testimony (21:24). Here it is certainly true: Jesus is dealing with the legal accusations of a group of Pharisees who have objected to his healing miracles. Earlier in this chapter Jesus very boldly claims, 'the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son' (5:22). In God’s courtroom, Jesus is not the defense attorney; he is the Judge. Jesus goes on to state here that Moses (the Law) will serve as the prosecution. \n\tIt must be understood that while God’s Law shows us the divine moral ordering of the universe, it also always accuses sinners of their sinfulness. The Law shows no one is right with God—and that was the Pharisees’ problem. And ours too. The fact that they—and we—overlook the truth about our legal standing means that we end up missing our need for a savior. \n\tWhen we hear talk about God’s holiness or glory, very often the response is pie-eyed delight, not run-and-hide Edenic fear. Many contemporary worship songs go on and on about God’s holiness and grandeur, but they also fail to recognize the fact that God’s holiness shames us. Next to the perfect, the imperfect is obliterated. It’s true.\n\tBut the Gospel of John tells us something else entirely. Way back in the introduction to the Gospel, John writes that 'The law came through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ' (1:17). The Gospel tells us that Judge Jesus is also Jesus the Condemned. The reason Jesus can make a non-condemning ruling and declare sinners righteous is that the price for not keeping the Law has been paid in his own blood—the judge takes all the blame himself, freeing us from the defendant’s chair. \n—Ben Phillips"

When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.",
		"text": "When you hear about God’s deliverance, what image springs to mind? For the Jews of Jesus’ day, it was a combination of a new Moses—someone who would give them the Law—and a new David, a political leader who could fulfill the nation’s 'manifest destiny' of political hegemony.\n\tJesus reproduces Moses’ greatest feat of provision, which is free bread all around. People love this and are deeply impressed. Indeed, the whole miraculous-power ministry is so effective that Dostoevsky, in The Brothers Karamazov, asks why Jesus doesn’t just stick to it. It certainly works for making people believe.\n\tBut unfortunately, it’s the wrong kind of belief they’re buying into. They want a strong, powerful Messiah who makes sense to them. Later, Jesus tries to correct their view, using his newfound publicity to make a point about eating and drinking his body. The crowds leave in droves.\n\tSometimes when we think we’re following Jesus the most, we’re actually attaching our own hopes of political power, self-improvement, or any other sense of 'being in the right.' Encountering the Gospel always turns this upside-down. Karl Barth said that the Bible, honestly read, 'makes straight for the one point where we must decide to accept or reject the sovereignty of God.' Unfortunately, we all avoid this point by projecting our own hopes onto Christ—whose ministry was actually meant to free us from petty, navel-gazing self-improvement and our perpetual need to be in the right. \n\tSo what does true faith look like? Admitting our weakness and lack of faith, first off. But that’s not the takeaway here. Moses had demanded faith from the Israelites in the wilderness, strictly forbidding them to gather leftovers, so they were forced to 'let go and let God.' But in Jesus’ lived retelling, there are twelve baskets of leftovers. Instead of 'let go and let God,' God just provides, to point of excess, despite knowing we’ll somehow fashion his provision with our own ideas for God (we don’t 'let' Him do a thing). But still He provides, regardless of how weak our faith is or how we feel at any given moment.\n\tAgain, what springs to mind when you think of God’s deliverance? If you and I are honest, it’s probably not exactly what Jesus had in mind—maybe it’s deliverance from singleness, the resuscitation of a loveless marriage, a way out of what seems to be a dead-end job. But the good news is that regardless of how well we think we understand or how much we fail to 'get it,' God still, always, provides fully. \n—Will McDavid"

In 2011, Slate.com reported that 'The average [American] high school kid today has the same level of anxiety as the average psychiatric patient in the early 1950s.'16F Everyone accounts for the rise slightly differently—technology, workaholism, narcissism, religious decline, etc—but no one denies the problem. The comforts of modern life have not come without a mental and emotional cost. \n\tPerhaps more worrying are the ways we’ve chosen to deal with our collective anxiety. We self-medicate with substances and entertainment. We spend more than we make. We put on a happy face, both in person and online. We do whatever we can to avoid feeling bad. \n\tSome would say that we’ve embraced a general 'feel-goodism' that does us more harm than good. Pain is fought and denied rather than tolerated or confessed. Sadly, the same is true in the church. Instead of defeat and failure, we talk about struggle. We hedge our prayer requests in phrases meant to exonerate God from culpability. We condemn ourselves (and are condemned by others) for our less-than-savory feelings. 'I shouldn’t feel this way.' 'A Christian doesn’t feel such things.' It may be endemic, but that doesn’t prevent it from being emotional quicksand. Our intolerance toward pain makes the pain worse. \n\tJesus understands this. When confronted with a woman caught in adultery, he does not heap condemnation upon condemnation. He doesn’t affirm her wrongdoing—of course not. But neither does he condemn her. Walker Percy once wrote that 'We love those who know the worst of us and don’t turn their faces away.' Christ sees the worst in her and doesn’t turn his face away.17F And that’s enough. The simple absence of judgment when it is most expected (and maybe even deserved) is a saving act for this woman. \n\tIf you’ve ever experienced this sort of non-judgment in the face of real wrongdoing, you know that when it happens, it’s a miracle. Fortunately, God sending His son into the world is a miracle. But perhaps the greater miracle is that God 'sent his son into to the world not to condemn the world but to save it' (John 3:17). Jesus does not condemn you for your anxieties and fears, however founded or unfounded they may be. He does not hedge or deny or put a band-aid on your pain, and He is not asking you to, either. Instead, like the woman caught in adultery, the place of rawness and weakness and guilt and vulnerability is the place where His love for us becomes real, where we encounter the Friend of Sinners in all His counter-intuitive glory. \n\tSo how are you refusing to 'go there' today? Where are you telling Christ that he is wrong not to condemn you? That you know his business better than he does? Well, he doesn’t condemn you for your inability to give up on your self-destructive compulsions. He didn’t turn his face away then, and he does not turn his face away today either.

He’s punching holes in the darkness!'\n\tThis is what Jesus means in John 8, that he punches holes in the darkness. It means that while we are powerless to push against the gloom that closes in, this gloom is Jesus’ place of operation. Our hope is not that we can be strong enough to 'bring light into dark places,' but that Jesus is powerful enough and willing to do something about it.\n\tPerhaps the darkness within is something you live with, something you keep doing. Maybe you have this horrible sense that since that you made your mess, you have to deal with it or clean it up. Perhaps it is something that has been done to you.

We shouldn’t weep, people think, because our friend is in a better place, because God is working through it—and we wouldn’t be sobbing or screaming or paralyzed if we 'just had faith' or 'had our heads on right.' \n\tChrist proves all of these attempts to minimize or avoid suffering to be utterly wrongheaded. Not only does Jesus know that Lazarus is headed to a better place, but he also knows that his friend will be brought back to life almost immediately. And yet that knowledge doesn’t make the anguish go away. He sobs for his friend’s death even though he knows it’s only temporary; he sobs for Mary and Martha’s grief even though he knows that it, too, will soon turn to joy. It’s not just that he gives us permission to grieve, but he grieves himself, even though his 'faith' and 'perspective' and all those other traits—inevitably hapless clichés to actual sufferers—are really there; they’re real. He cannot outthink his grief, and there’s no possible way that we can.\n\tJesus grieves for the sickness, the death, and all the other physical and emotional ailments that plague the world. He knows, better than anyone, that all will be redeemed, but this gives him as little real comfort in the moment of suffering as it gives us. Christ’s ability to grieve isn’t an act, and he perhaps grieves not less than us for being the Son of God, but more. It is his compassion, his divine sadness, and his unique share in the collective distress of humanity that allow him to save the world. Human sin and suffering affect him on such a deep level that he wants to take the entire weight of guilt, pain, and death upon himself as his body becomes the eternal, crucified lament of an abject humanity.

This is true of what Jesus is saying, too: being pruned oftentimes feels very painful, as if some large part of you that was once deeply connected to life has been severed. It can feel as though one’s wounds have been left raw to face the elements. It can feel like God has deliberately disconnected Himself, and one’s protests are met only with silence. \n\tWe can take heart from Christ’s words: God prunes every branch that doesn’t bear fruit, so that it will be even more fruitful.

Because He abides in us and we in Him, we can be certain that even the most painful pruning experiences are for the sake of His great love. \n—Bonnie Poon Zahl"

Maybe your kids aren’t making decisions the way you think they should and you’re growing resentful. Maybe your spouse isn’t giving you what you think you deserve and you’ve become cold.\n\tRun a book search on Amazon for 'loving others' and you’ll get over 41,000 results, almost all of them self-help books offering techniques on loving people better. This certainly tells us we have a problem on our hands, but it also tells us the answer isn’t a simple one. This becomes especially problematic in light of this passage: Jesus is commanding us to love others as he has loved us. Right. Let’s get on that one.\n\tWe can try to 'get better' at loving people. We place an emphasis on ourselves, on tips and techniques to help us work at it. This inevitably leads to frustration, because not one in 41,000 ever fully works. And honestly, this is the death we must die. Rather than empower us, Jesus’ command kills—who can love this way? \n\tThanks be to God, that’s not the end of the story. When our loveless propensities have done their number on us, God is faithful to raise us to new life through His own, one-way love in Jesus: 'As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.' Jesus loves us the way the Father loves him! The same love that raises Jesus from the dead is what raises us from our dead lovelessness, day after day. \n\tThis love is the only thing that can generate this crazy, outlandish one-way love in us. Hearing this good news takes our eyes off our successes and failures in the love department, and places them on the One who loves us perfectly. Only when we rest in God’s perfect love for us will we begin to know what loving others even means.\n—Curt Benham"

		"text": "In this chapter of John’s Gospel, Jesus is explaining to the disciples why it is better for him to go away than to stay. We can all relate to the disciples’ question. Wouldn’t life be easier if Jesus were still here, in flesh and blood, to talk to, to learn from, to minister to us, to answer our questions? Instead we are left with an invisible God, and it is not always easy to believe in something invisible. How could this be better than having Jesus with us?\n\tJesus’ answer is that he has gone away for our own good, so that he could send to us an Advocate, the Spirit, whose involvement in our lives and in the world will be even more wonderful than Jesus’ own.\n\tThis Spirit is an Advocate, a Paraclete. He is our advocate, in the world and before God. The Spirit is always on our side, and the Spirit is always with us. You cannot escape God’s advocacy. 'Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? ... Even the darkness is not dark to thee.' (Psalm 139:7, 12). There is nowhere you can go to get away from being known and loved and defended and sought by the Spirit of God.\n\tAnd this is true whether we like it or not. In verse 8 we are told that this Advocate is also the one who convicts us of sin. The Spirit is the one who reveals the truths we want to keep hidden and who looks at what we think is the best of ourselves and sees it for what it is.\n\tSometimes I wish I could stay in the darkness rather than face such light. 'Even the darkness is not dark to thee.' Sometimes I am afraid of this Advocate, this fire from heaven that burns in order to heal, this Spirit of truth who sees through my lies. At the end of the chapter, Jesus says it straight: 'you will have pain, but your pain will turn into joy' (John 16:20). May it be so.\n—Simeon Zahl"

But my kingdom is not from the world.' Then Pilate said to him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world— to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.' Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, 'I find no guilt in him.'",
		"text": "How would other 'gods' have responded to Pilate? Zeus would have his thunderclap. The Messiah everyone wanted would have called an army down to conquer the Romans. The possibilities for divine extrication are endless, but none would have selected crucifixion. Voluntary, ultimate worldly defeat is not 'godly' in the traditional sense. Our concept of higher powers—God or Rome or money—determines our understanding of truth. \n\tNietzsche calls Pilate’s Socratic response to these words, 'What is truth?' 'the only saying that has any value' in the New Testament. Undoubtedly, Pilate is puzzled by Jesus’ enigmatic 'defense.' Betrayed and denied by his followers, Jesus does not even offer any argument for acquittal. \n\tPilate does not wait for, or expect, a response to his question. As a Roman prefect, he has been criticized for his treatment of Jews and Jewish customs. Despite his misgivings regarding Christ’s guilt, to avoid further Jewish unrest and accusations about him to Rome, he seeks the 'truth' by turning to the congregated masses. Truth was not objective but only what would serve Roman order and his personal interests.\n\tNineteenth Century Russian painter Nikolai Ge’s painting Quod Est Veritas (What is Truth?), contrasts Jesus, a ragged vagabond, before stately Pilate, well polished in his finely-folded toga. Pilate poses the question Socratically, while already turning from Jesus to the waiting crowd. The light of Rome shines from behind Pilate but does not grasp Jesus, almost void of form, and unreachable to those who are not yet 'of the truth,' who cannot listen to his voice.\n\tJesus does not become man to conquer this world. If, in response to Pilate, Jesus and his 'servants' vanquished his Jewish and Roman oppressors before ascending to heaven, we would be left with the Law of God, 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect.' And, though many religions or theories, including versions of Christianity, do see religion as continuous striving to emulate moral perfection, perfection is not attainable. We require atonement for our sins, so that we may be freed from the condemnation of the Law.\n\tThe truth is that Christianity is necessarily linked with death. Christ bears witness to this truth, not through his achievements in this world, but through his death on the cross, so that by him and through him, we may be given life by the Spirit that raised him from the dead.\n—Ron Flowers"

'How can the Second Person of the Trinity thirst?' wonders theologian Stanley Hauerwas, answering that 'surely this must be meant metaphorically. But if this is only a metaphor—something said for our benefit to insure that in spite of being the second person of the Trinity Jesus tries to identify with our lot—the cross is just a cruel joke' (71).\n \tGoing back to the first century, there has remained within Christianity a docetic tendency to turn the cross into an object lesson, a huge graphic parable that God uses to show us how bad we are, how much we’re loved, how bad the Romans are, etc. But none of these attempts (which are alive and well up to this present day) have been able to do justice to what we see happening here. \n\tThis cry of Jesus helps emphasize an aspect of the cross that we wrestle with. That the cross is a punishment is clear, but that it is also the substitutionary death of the One who thirsts on our behalf, so we will have to thirst no more, is something we’ve often missed. \n\tThis is where a proper distinction between Law and Gospel becomes crucial, because even though we all thirst, the Law exposes the deadly, destructive futility of our wells. As Jesus told the Samaritan woman, 'Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again' (John 4). The Law exposes, convicts, and leads to the Gospel, the fount of living water.\n\tIn light of this universal thirst, we have simply this proclamation of the Gospel to offer, a sip of wine and a bit of bread to slake people’s thirst and ward off hunger. This seems unfortunate because, certainly, we would love to offer more. Promises of health, wealth, and security are nicer to make, but 'those and 13 dollars will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks,' as they say.\n\tLike nomads in the desert, we have found an oasis of living water in the message of 'God’s one-way love to sinners,' and trust that we will be among those referenced in the book of Revelation, of whom it is said:\nThey shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes (Rev 7:16-17).\n—Jady Koch"

The other stands gleaming white and empty, a potent symbol of the promise that in Jesus 'death has lost its sting.' And as much as we profess faith in the victory, it is telling that the crucifix stands over the pulpit and the empty cross over the Lord’s Table; one signifies where we are, and the other signifies where we will be 'when he comes again in glory.' Until then, these words from the cross remain our hope.\n\tLiving in the 'sufferings of the present age' means living with the lot of wanting more. In this agony where Christ hung, he calls out, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' John’s Gospel puts it only slightly differently: 'It is finished.' This is what we have, the basis of our faith, that holds on, as David Ford says, during our overwhelming. 'This overwhelming,' writes Stanley Hauerwas, '[allows] us to live not because we have answers to all the world’s troubles, but because God has given us a way to live without answers' (88).\n\tBut before we grow our beards out, throw up our hands and retreat into the mystery of 24/7 Eucharistic adoration, let us be clear about what we can say, because too often the 'sufferings of this present age' force pastors and theologians—and I am as culpable as anyone—to unanswered, unfinished speculation about the cross that subverts Jesus’ very cry. \n\tWhat’s worse, today’s moral teachers, across the political and theological spectrum, have turned this end into a beginning. 'See,' it is argued, 'Jesus did it all, now get going and do (or stop) x-y-z, because that can’t really be all there is to it.' This is a tragic irony: the very words signifying an actual end to something are parlayed into motivational grist for the mill of the suffering soul. \n\tIn direct and steadfast opposition to this, we never tire of insisting that 'it is finished' means just that. Everything that ever needed to be done or ever will need to be done by us to be reconciled to God has been done. God is in control. He is redeeming the world. We cannot mess up His plan because, well, 'it is finished.' We are free to live as people in the 'sufferings of this present age,' living squarely in the shadow of the crucifix, 'always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks a reason for the hope' (1 Peter 3:15). In this hope we wait, because although our end has not yet come, the only 'it' that matters is already finished.\n—Jady Koch"

Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.' he said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.' Thomas answered him, 'My Lord and my God!'",
		"text": "'Doubting Thomas' is an inaccurate title. Let’s simply call a thing what a thing is. Disbelieving, distrusting, betraying Thomas. Thomas witnesses the amazing miracles Christ performed, including the raising of Lazarus from the dead; he has been journeying with him for years now. It is astonishing that, in spite of all the glorious acts and miracles, Thomas does not altogether apprehend Christ as his Savior (John 14:1-14). Thomas has no excuse. He is damnable—a skeptic who has spent all this time with the Son of God, witnessing everything, and still does not believe. If anyone is worthy of the lake of fire, Thomas is.\n\tWhat if you do not believe? Thomas does not believe, and he receives no short shrift for it. But of course, the scary—and true—thing is that we can all relate to this kind of skepticism. Maybe he’s upset. I know that I would be depressed and bitter just like Thomas. I would make outlandish if-then ultimatums, too, 'If..., then...I will never believe.'\n\tBeing God as he is, Jesus has a word for Thomas, and his verdict runs contrary to Thomas’ disbelief. Instead of Thomas getting a scolding, Jesus carries the wounds in his hands. And not only does Jesus invite Thomas to see his wounds, the wounds that are holding all of Thomas’ sin, but also he allows Thomas to place his fingers in them, to feel the wounds which bear his sin. In short, Christ shows Thomas what’s been taken from him. \n\tChrist wishes to be known to you as the forgiver of your sins, and even if you deny it, he’s coming to you. He died for your sins and was raised for your justification (Rom 4:25). The one who reveals to you the holes in his hands has atoned for all your flaws, all your betrayals, all your mistakes.

		"text": "A quick recap of Peter’s 'greatest hits' in the New Testament:\nWhen Jesus tells him to walk on water, Peter is afraid and sinks.\nPeter tries to persuade Jesus that he will not have to die, to which Jesus responds: 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God but the things of men.'\nHe falls asleep in Gethsemane, three times, after being asked three times not to do so. \nHe denies Jesus three times, despite his protestations after being told in no uncertain terms that he was going to do so. \nHe draws his sword in Gethsemane and is rebuked for it.\nHe gets rebuked asking about John, the beloved disciple ('what is it to you?').\nWe are even told that, after the disciples first hear reports of the Resurrection, Peter loses the race to the empty tomb. \nIt would seem that nearly everything Peter does in the Gospels ends in a correction, a rebuke, or a red-cheeked failure. With one notable exception, of course: when asked by Jesus, 'Who do you say that I am?', Peter acknowledges that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and he is the first of the disciples to do so. Otherwise, though, one almost wonders whether Jesus’ name for him, which means 'rock,' was an ironic gesture. Far from acting as a stable leader of the faith, when it was time for action, he could be relied upon to fail. Indeed, short of him rejecting the faith entirely, it is hard to imagine a worse Christian than Peter. And yet in this passage, the resurrected Christ gives Peter even more authority than he had before. Why?\n\tIn his early novel The Cabala, the great American writer Thornton Wilder gives us a clue: 'All gods and heroes are by nature the enemies of Christianity... Only a broken will can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Finally tired out with the cult of themselves they give in. They go over. They renounce themselves.'\n\tIt is no coincidence that Peter is both the weakest and the one who recognizes who Jesus is. He can recognize the savior because he knows how much needs one. The archetypal Christian is not a person who looks like Jesus, but a person who looks like she needs Jesus. Many of us are full of shame deep down because of our private failures and our private fears. Like Peter, we question whether God would love us and care for us if He really knew what went on—and how we really feel—and if He really knew how little we think about Him some days, and how often we choose our own desires over His commands.\n\tThe comfort that Peter finds on the beach is our comfort, too, that the only thing God requires of you and me is our deep-seeded and ongoing need. Like Peter, we are met in our shame and embarrassment and to our great surprise, given the opposite of what we deserve. \n—David Zahl"

Other times they are profound, as when Martin Luther took his last breath clutching a piece of paper that read, 'We are beggars.' \n\tWhat message did Jesus feel deserved his final moments? Basically, that in the film of our lives, we are actors, not directors. But there is a director, who is God. This sentiment may sound self-evident, but it is not. In fact, it remains as controversial as it is comforting.\n\tWoody Allen once observed, 'Luck guides our lives much more than we care to admit. Coming out of an age of psychoanalysis, people tend not to feel that way. They tend to feel, ‘I’m in control.’ ...My observations in life have not been that. Luck plays a much greater role—a frightening role in our lives.' Replace the word 'luck' with 'God,' and you have something pretty similar to what Jesus is trying to communicate here. \n\tWe are not in control of our world—hurricanes and recessions and accidents tell us that much. But a far less popular conviction is that we are not in control of our own lives, that we do not have authority. I was speaking to a woman recently who had just fallen in love. She told me that at first she had strongly resisted the relationship, saying, 'It just wasn’t part of my plan. I figured I would be much more established in my career before something like this happened.' She had come face to face with the futility of her plans. In her case, they almost derailed the happiness they were designed to achieve. Sound familiar?\n\tWe have been relieved of an authority we never had in the first place. The authority belongs to God, and He is not like the policemen and politicians and parents that we normally associate with the word. He has exercised His authority by laying it down, and He did so for you and me, that we might be relieved of our endless, vain attempts to seize it back. In this way, the last words of Jesus transform fear into freedom and give rest to those who are exhausted. Father actually does know best, and that bears repeating. \n—David Zahl"

The author Annie Dillard is talking about the Holy Spirit when she says, 'It is madness to wear velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews.'\n\tPentecost is all about power, and the proof is in the pudding: Peter the Sandpile becomes Peter the Rock. The disciples heal people who are sick. Their lifestyles change—they start living in community, they share their possessions in common, they give to the poor with extravagance. Some of them are killed for their faith. Finally, they convert the Roman Empire.\n \tWhat’s the vital factor that took these weak, divided individuals and molded them into one strong body? The key to Pentecost power is, well, weakness. As St. Paul puts it, 'I will all the more gladly boast of my weakness, in order that the power of Christ may rest upon me' (2 Cor 12:9).\n\tAn example of Pentecost power in weakness happened in Northern Ireland some years ago. You may remember it, because a photograph of the incident became quite famous. Two British undercover agents were driving a car near a funeral of the Irish Republican Army. They turned down a wrong street and drove too close to the funeral procession, and a gang of IRA men stopped them, dragged them from the car, stripped them, beat them, shot them, and left them to die.\n\tOut of the door of the local church and into the street came a Roman Catholic priest. Here was a moment of utter weakness and failure on all sides. But this priest was a person who had faced and acknowledged his own weakness, and had heard the risen Jesus say to him, 'Peace be with you.' So out of the door and into the street he went. He walked up to one of those fallen undercover agents. He knelt beside him, crouched over him, pressed his lips to the lips of his political enemy, and tried to breathe life back into his body,\n\tAnd in that moment on that little side street, one priest did what all those bombs and bullets could not do. He broke down the dividing wall of hostility—and Love had the last word.\n\tWhenever the disciples are weak, Jesus says to them, 'Peace be with you.' So remember a weak moment in your life, either this past week or a long time ago. Picture Jesus standing right in front of you at that exact moment, looking you in the eye, and saying to you, 'Peace be with you.' This is the key to Pentecost power.\n—Jim Munroe"

If the doctor told me that I was in fairly good shape for a man of my age, weight and personal habits, my 'takeaway' would be 'What did he miss?' or 'That’s what they all say before the big one hits.' \n\tThe response I usually get for my admittedly sour outlook is that I need to 'have more faith' and 'trust God with the future,' or worst of all, that passive-aggressive advice-in-the-interrogative, 'Have you prayed about it?' Well, no, of course I haven’t, and if I did it would just be a prayer of pure anxiety with a 'Dear God' prefix and an 'In Christ’s name' conclusion! \n\tSo what can be made of this passage from Acts, this shockingly optimistic, confident prayer, in which God is seen as in control, even of those who had crucified Jesus, to do His loving and perfect will? Is this prayer an early version of 'Let go and let God?' It just doesn’t strike me that way. Because it seems like a genuinely happy prayer, not a prayer that is trying to be theologically correct, not a contrived, ginned up, 'have faith' kind of show-prayer. I think we all want this prayer, this optimism and even joy, but where does this come from? \n\tNot from me, that’s certain. And not from God—that is, not from God in the abstract, not 'God is in heaven so all is right with the world.' God as a conceptual part of 'the life equation' may have produced some successful dissertations, but not much palpable joy. And God as a coping mechanism has always been prone to mechanical failure when a cancer diagnosis surfaces.\n\tWhat I love about this prayer is that it is prayed by people who are as afraid of life and the future as I am. So how can Peter and the puny church pray this way? It is, it seems to me, not the prayer of the faithful, but of the forgiven. The joy and confidence that spills from this prayer seems to come solely from the free gift of God’s love and forgiveness in the crucified and risen Jesus. Peter has denied the Lord three times at the crucial test of his faithfulness. In return, he has been loved, forgiven, and given a promotion! Many of the others praying this prayer had surely cried 'crucify him' not long before. Yet they, too, 'cut to the heart' by the knowledge of who they really are and what God has done, receive not only forgiveness from God, but also the gift of His Holy Spirit. They have experienced a God who comforts his assassins. \n\tThat alone, I believe, can calm the anxious heart. It can give those—like me, who regret the past, fear the present and dread the future—a ground for hope, and even for some real, come-what-may joy. That, anyway, is my little prayer for you and me today. \n—Michael Cooper"

You have not lied to men but to God...'",
		"text": "It’s easy to think that the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira are brought on more by their selfishness than their dishonesty. The distinction may seem negligible, but it’s important. Without it, it’s easy to come away from this passage thinking that they are expected to give away everything, when instead they are punished for claiming to have given everything when they really haven’t. But it still sounds very crude: why would such an action provoke so unmerciful a response? Is lying really their death sentence, or is there a deeper issue present in their situation? \n\tI believe the root of Ananias and Sapphira’s deception stems from not wanting to give anything at all. Deep down, they want to keep all the money from the property to themselves, but aware that others in the church have donated all their money to the church, the two want to save face. They are more concerned about the outward appearances of Christian love than being honest about where they stand. \n\tRather than being a fable about lying, though, this passage conveys that Ananias and Sapphira should not have felt obligated to give anything at all. 'Sincerity' in this context would have meant being open with the church about their desire not to give. I think their lives would never have been in jeopardy had they kept every cent of the money for themselves instead of pretending to be generous. \n\tSo honesty, and the freedom which stems from it, seem to be the key issues here. Peter questions Ananias, 'Didn’t [the land] belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal?' Peter makes it clear to Ananias that he had been under no obligation whatsoever to give all, part, or any of his money to anyone. Because Christ has come, because he has taken our debt and paid in full, our God-appeasing tithe is covered. Through Christ, all God’s requirements for us have been met. \n\tWhat’s terrifying, then, is that Ananias and Sapphira don’t drop dead for deceiving or withholding truth from God, but for believing what is untrue of God. They believe they must give something; that in order to be acceptable before God and church, something is required. Ananias and Sapphira hold as truth their requirements and pretenses, and reject the truth of Christ’s freedom. Because they believe their lives are being tallied, God takes their lives, leaving them in the only thing Jesus needs for their resurrection: their death. \n—Jeremy Coleman"

Or are you still in the 'gall of bitterness' toward someone—a parent, an ex-boyfriend, a sibling, an old friend who ditched you, a minister who let you down?\n\tEven as Peter has pretty harsh words for Simon here, he also views the ex-magician with mercy: he calls Simon’s iniquity a 'bond' or (in other translations) a 'chain.' In other words, Peter sees that Simon is bitter, but also that he cannot help feeling this way. Acknowledging this, about ourselves and about others, is the beginning of mercy and a firm foundation for prayer.\n—Simeon Zahl"

In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, 'Please come to us without delay.' So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, 'Tabitha, arise.' And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.",
		"text": "Luke tells us that Tabitha, or Dorcas, is 'full of good works and acts of charity,' yet she falls ill and dies. A disciple, filled with the beneficence of God, gets sick and dies—how is that fair? Doesn’t she deserve to be healed? Often this cry is thought in our hearts, but the truth is that we don’t know what fair means. A small child can make this observation; having never known 'fair,' they have an innate sense that the bad and the painful, the consequences of this life, are often 'undeserved' or 'unfair.' Tabitha does not deserve to die, we say—her hard work has earned life, hasn’t it? Why, if God is good, would God let the good die? \n\tOur side of the story is quid-pro-quo. According to our ethic, you get what you work for, what you put in is what you get out, and good people get good stuff. This may be our side of the story, but it’s not the full story. \n\tThe Old Testament certainly doesn’t paint this picture—humanity seems completely deserving of the death of entire peoples, destruction of temples, God forsakenness. Here humanity is, in fact, incapable of anything that warrants a 'Well done!' from the Almighty. \n\tYet in spite of the incredible failures that we are, the New Testament tells of the light of redemption. Humankind doesn’t deserve these things: we, prior to Christ, lie dead in all our good works and noble efforts, waiting for a miracle of salvation from death, just like Tabitha. Just like Tabitha, our good works can’t and don’t resurrect us—we need the mercy of saving grace.\n\tIn Christ, our works are not weighed, good or bad. In Christ, we are given life, for Christ’s saving breath enters our souls and we rise out of death, completely upending our impressions of fairness (Eph 2:5).\n—Lauren R.E. Larkin"

		"text": "In his song 'Riding for the Feeling,' Bill Callahan (of the band Smog) describes a character in front of a room of questioners. This character—perhaps Callahan himself—wonders if he’s 'said enough,' but everyone else, despite having no more questions, asks him to stay, because they’ve got nowhere else to go. The speaker doesn’t seem to want to go either: \nI kept hoping for one more question\nOr for someone to say,\n'Who do you think you are?' \nSo I could tell them \nWith intensity, the drop evaporates by law\nIn conclusion, leaving is easy\nWhen you’ve got some place you need to be\nI’m giving up this gig for another season\nSometimes when we must go—whether it’s skipping town or breaking up or quitting work—the 'letting go' is the hardest thing to do. Knowing we must do so, we still tend to wait around for one more question or acknowledgment or paycheck before we ride off, and we find ourselves in the territory of 'kicking against the goads.' \n\tThis seems to be the way Paul explains his conversion on the road to Damascus. Usually we just read that Paul was riding, gets blinded out of nowhere, and his commanding influence as persecutor is retrofitted for the stadium preaching circuit. Here, as he explains it to Agrippa, it seems more like Jesus comes to him to compassionately point out, 'Paul, you’ve been feeling this way a while now. This is stupid. It’s hurting you not to yield!' Jesus says what Paul has not been willing to see or admit to himself, namely, that he wants to 'give up this gig for another season.' \n\tCan we surrender like this, though? Could the Apostle Paul do this? Does Jesus think we can do this? Just 'die?' Just 'let go?' It’s like trying to grace oneself into a cold swimming pool; there’s no real way to do it.\n\tI keep having this dream where Jesus is asking me to jump out of an airplane in faith. (I’m terrified of heights.) I’m holding this steel bar with my jumpsuit on, plane hatch now spilling wild space air into the cabin, and all I have to do, at 24,000 feet or whatever, is let go. Just let go. I will fly and fall into the wild air of God’s mercy and therein find new, free, strangely secure life.\n\tIt doesn’t matter that Jesus is my parachuting captain—the thought is crazy. I will not let go. The only way I’m coming off that plane, in the air, is if my sweaty palms lose their hold—or if Jesus 'kills' me, actually jerks me from my death grip, to fall into the unknown. This is no low estimation—this is what must happen. \n\tThankfully, this is what does happen.  Though we are not able to 'give up the gig,' to say goodbye to old selves, to let go of old habits, God’s gracious light violently dismounts us. As Paul is thrown from his horse, so, too, does God kill us, to resurrect a 'new season' in dead bones.\n\tWhat about you? Where are these 'dead bones' in your life? Where in life are you 'kicking against the goads,' and how are you kicking them? Where do you find yourself incapable of saying goodbye, incapable of yielding? Our only hope for these places is demonstrated in Paul’s testimony, where the Lord meets us on the road to glory and graciously throws us to the ground. \n—Ethan Richardson"

So they cast off the anchors and... they made for the beach. But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. The centurion... ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the land, and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship.",
		"text": "This passage from Acts finds the apostles Paul and Luke (the author of the passage) on a boat in the middle of a terrifying storm. The wind is relentless. They are at the mercy of the elements. Verse 15 graphically describes their predicament: 'when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.' They recognize their impotence and yield. \n\tTrying to save themselves, they start taking well-intentioned steps to control the situation. This is a normal human response. First, the crew girds the ship by tying ropes around the hull. This doesn’t work. So the next day, they throw cargo overboard. This also fails, so they throw the tackle overboard. Rational steps, right? But in the end, they have made no progress. \n\tWill God now step in and rescue them? No: verse 20 reads, 'And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many a day, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.' These are shocking words, especially coming from Saint Luke, the writer of two books of the Bible, in the company of Saint Paul, the greatest missionary of all time. And yet he says it: they abandoned all hope of being saved. \n\tWhen we face storms in our life—internal and external—we usually try to control them, like Luke and his shipmates. But our attempts usually fail. We try to make the right person love us; we try to beat an addiction through willpower; we try to change a spouse’s behavior; we try to perfectly develop a career; we try to attract a wayward child home through cajoling, pleading, or yelling. But our efforts fail. Despite all Luke and Paul’s efforts, they are shipwrecked. In fact, the surf totally destroys the boat. Paul and his companions are washed on shore, clinging to broken pieces of the ship.\n\tThis kind of shipwreck story is a paradigm for the Christian life. For all of us, storms will come and all hope will be lost. Of all people, Christians should remember that death must come before resurrection. The problem is that many of us are working really, really hard to keep the ship together. We’ve strapped ropes around the ships of our lives in a desperate attempt to keep them afloat. We tell ourselves that things are not that bad, our spouse will change, our job will change, we will change.\n\tSuch self-deception is exhausting. This passage tells us that sometimes the ship must break apart. There must be a moment when we realize our marriage has failed, our child has cut herself off from the family, our career is at a dead-end. This admission is honesty with ourselves and with God. In other words, repentance—because when we realize how bad it is, we call out for help. And in doing so, we trust God. This is the place where, in religious terms, we are saved. \n\tGod, in His mercy, may let the whole ship, everything around you, break apart. And you may be washed on shore with only the clothes on your back, metaphorically speaking. But God is at work, and you may be surprised where you wash ashore.

		"text": "This passage finds the Apostle Paul at the end of his life, under house arrest in Rome. In verse 28, Luke tells us that Paul was 'testifying to the kingdom of God.' In verse 31, we read that Paul was 'preaching the kingdom of God.' So: testifying to and preaching the kingdom. This is how Paul ended his life. So we would do well to make sure we understand what this kingdom is.\n\tGoogle-searching 'kingdom of God' yields over ten million hits. It’s also one of those Christian buzzwords you hear if you move in evangelical circles. There’s talk of 'kingdom professionals,' 'kingdom builders,' and living by 'kingdom principles.' Christian organizations have mission statements that speak of 'establishing God’s kingdom.' New churches talk about the way of the kingdom, with a heavy emphasis on actions and habits. Common to all this talk of the kingdom of God is the idea that the kingdom is primarily about what Christians do. We make the kingdom happen.\n\tIf you look at how Luke describes Paul’s actions vis-à-vis 'the kingdom,' Paul simply testified and preached. That is, he was a witness to the kingdom as something already here—that’s what a testimony is. And second, the kingdom was a message to proclaim. Paul announced the kingdom. Not much building or establishing here. Just talking about something that God has already done.\n\tThis flows directly from Jesus’ talk about the kingdom of God. Take a look at Mark 4:26-27: 'The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how.' God is the actor behind the kingdom. He establishes it; He makes it grow. The farmer—that is, us—doesn’t even know how it happens. Also note Jesus’ words in Luke 10:9: 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' It comes near to us. The movement is from God to us. We don’t bring it down. \n\tFinally, two other statements from Jesus about the kingdom are worth a look. In Mark 10:14-15, Jesus famously says, 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.' And in Matthew 21:31 we hear Jesus say, 'Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.' What both these passages convey is that the kingdom of God is something powerless, sinful people enter; it is not some kind of world system that triumphant Christians build. \n\tThe bottom line is that the kingdom is something God does, and brings about apart from human effort. Secondly, it is for the powerless, the sinners. Thus Paul rightfully understood that the kingdom is something you announce, you testify to, you preach, because it is something God has established. It is a place where sins are forgiven and the weak and sinful can come in. And once you’re in, God continues to be the one to do the work in you. As Jesus says, the kingdom grows, but we don’t even know how. It grows in you, but not because of your effort. It just happens.\n—Aaron Zimmerman"

The show always ended by saying, 'Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.' The first chapter of Romans quite differently defines immorality as un-dependent on knowledge. Merely knowing right and wrong does not work to persuade or dissuade.\n\tOftentimes I think back on past mistakes and think of how foolish I was. In retrospect I realize how myopic my decision-making was, or how blinded I was by ambition or selfishness. I often think, 'If only I had known then what I know now,' then things would be different. If I’m truly honest, I know that knowing more doesn’t guarantee that I would act differently. In fact, most times I know the possible consequences of my actions, and still I make the same mistakes.\n\tFor instance, I know that eating large amounts of ice cream with brownies is going to make me fat. I know that the food pyramid recommends that I eat some 6-8 fruits and vegetables each day. Yet on days when I am particularly stressed, just try to stop me from heading to the freezer and the microwave. I don’t think I’m alone here; it is not that the troubled teenager, the deceitful banker, the alcoholic, the rude neighbors do not know the right thing to do; the right thing to do is beyond their reach. Or as a friend of mine put it, 'It’s not that I don’t know what to do, it’s that I can’t do it.'\n\tIn the same way, St. Paul understands that sins do not occur from a lack of knowledge, but because of a sinful heart. I sin because I am a sinner and can’t help myself. I am powerless, against both my rational and subconscious impulses, to look out for myself.\n\tMore knowledge, understanding, or wisdom will not be our knight in shining armor. It is not enough to know the difference between right and wrong. What we need is for the Savior to rescue us from ourselves.\n—Todd Brewer"

'Christians' just can’t seem to understand that grace always ends up 'upholding the Law' in practice. You don’t have to worry. The Holy Spirit automatically creates works of loving from prior love.\n\tEven so, I don’t think the ministers of grace are ever going to 'persuade' the Christian community that grace applies to Christians. I have failed utterly at this for well over 30 years. Outsiders love the message; insiders resist it, even hate it. Probably we just have to 'let them go'—the 'Christians' I mean. Something about the way the religious (sub-)culture works just makes it impossible to hear the grace word there.

As expected, my friend’s father opened the envelope, scanned the grades, looked at my friend, said, 'Well, that’s pitiful,' and walked off in disgust. As he told me, I was reminded of Hank Williams’ famous 'Men with Broken Hearts,' which goes, 'Have you ever watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies?' My friend could help what was happening inside no more than he could help his father’s reaction.\n\tDid he deserve the rebuke? I suppose his father’s reaction was just. He hadn’t done enough work, he hadn’t gotten the grades, therefore he hadn’t gotten the praise that comes from achieving the grades. And his father’s expectations for achievement were not unfair or cruel in itself. I happen to know his father loved him, and for the most part, parents generally want their children to succeed and be happy.\n\tAnd yet his father failed to see what was really going on. That’s nothing new—any parent or boss or civic entity denies the deeper realities of bondage and deep hurt. Albeit unwittingly, this denial can sound an awful lot like cruelty to the 'Men with Broken Hearts.' The higher-up’s rebuke may be intended in loving interest; it still sounds like cruelty.\n\tThe message of Christianity is Romans 4:5, the good news of 'justification by grace alone, through faith alone.' It is exactly the inverse to the cruel, manipulative language of achievement. When my friend’s paralysis took him to a dark cave, he helplessly watched his own heart inside him die. Feeling alone and doomed, he found company in Jesus Christ and his cross, who made his home in that self-same cave, with the dysfunctional, paralyzed, and hurt. When the world walks out on us, muttering 'Pitiful,' our Lord turns to us and says, 'Surely I am with you, even to the end of days.'\n—David Browder"

Consumed by anxiety and agony over the impending examination of his credentials, he had a complete breakdown that led to three suicide attempts. Shortly after his third attempted suicide, Cowper, an accomplished writer, wrote a hymn entitled 'Praise for the Fountain Opened.' The words are a vivid, graphic and bold expression of what is known theologically as the atonement: \nThere is a fountain filled with blood drawn from \tEmmanuel’s veins;\nAnd sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty \tstains.\nLose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains;\nAnd sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty \tstains.\nHis continuing recovery led him to Olney, the parish of noted former slave trader and author of 'Amazing Grace,' John Newton. There, in 1779, Newton asked Cowper to contribute to a hymnal called the Olney Hymns. \n\tThe power of Cowper’s hymnody lies in its vivid, sharp, and often brutally human imagery. Without such concrete language, when we are led to abstract ruminations on the concept of God, we are in danger of further detaching our faith from everyday life. God floats back up to heaven and inhabits the sometimes intangible realms of peace and tranquility. In Cowper’s hymns, however, the reality of the cross—in the wood and the blood—destroys abstract pretension and proclaims the message of God to the world: Jesus was 'delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.'\n\tOnly from the cross can the everyday ramifications of the Gospel—the daily cycle of forgiving, receiving forgiveness, and reconciliation—be understood. This is what Cowper knew, and it is why the beauty of his hymns continue to haunt, convict and encourage: \nThe dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;\nAnd there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins \taway.\nWashed all my sins away, washed all my sins away;\nAnd there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins \taway \n—Jady Koch"

In this place, we discover a past in which we are at peace with God, a present in which we have full access to His mercy, and a future hope in sharing in His glory. But these gifts were won at the cost of suffering, namely Christ’s, and remain ours as we rethink the role of suffering in God’s world. \n\tLooking at verses three and four, suffering has such a therapeutic role in our lives that, rightly received, it enables us to endure the present while looking in hope to the future. This, says Paul, is the root of character—something that is always hammered out on the anvil of pain. \n\tFortunately, we do not have to gut this out as if it were up to us to manufacture character with steely determination.

Will I be forgiven again?' The answer, of course, is yes, we are still unable to keep ourselves from sinning, but Paul isn’t really asking this question—he is asking, 'shall we go on sinning?' to which his answer is, 'By no means!' The distinction is that while God’s Law still remains and the sins go along with it, we are no longer beholden to it because we have been set free by the love of God. He has taken our sins and given us salvation.\n\tNow then, are we like the young undergraduate, freshly separated from the control of nagging parents, thus confusing the absence of authority with 'freedom' to partake in sin and promiscuity? 'By no means!' While the Gospel does free us from the reign of sin and the anxiety brought by the Law, it does so with love and atonement rather than simply removing itself from the picture entirely. After all, the college freshman inside us all, released from the bondage of our parent’s dos and don’ts, isn’t really acting out of freedom, but instead out of rebellion against a power that still plagues us. We can still hear their voice from miles away. \n\tIt is only once we return home to find a father and a mother who look at us as we are and say, 'Son, I am pleased with you' that we experience the Gospel. It is only in this place that we may bury the guns and stop rebelling. No longer are we haunted by the voice of displeasure, but rather we are carried by the tune of great pleasure and acceptance. \n\tWhat is so freeing and rejuvenating about the Gospel and the grace of God is not the absence of God’s authority, but the presence of God’s love.

It is a word for those who are so gripped with remorse from something in the past that living in its wake is like death to them.

This kind of sermon leaves us indebted to the Law, so that the only room left for grace is gap-filler theology: the idea that when we do occasionally stumble, God says, 'that’s O.K.' \n\tThis is so completely contrary to what Paul is saying in Romans 7, but it doesn’t change the fact that many people approach 'God' and 'religion' this way. This belief does fail eventually, though it doesn’t tend to happen in church pews on Sundays—it’s in the hospital lobby, or late on a sleepless night, or with that impending decision your boss has yet to make. \n\tAt these points, when the chips are down—when we really need someone, when we see we can’t change things, when we feel guilty—then we find it hard to justify why we’ve gotten there. At that place and at that moment, our need overshadows however well-behaved we believe we’ve been in the eyes of God. \n\tBut this is also when freedom becomes real, when we see what grace truly means, because we realize that everything we could have tried to do would have come up short at this moment. At this point, when our preoccupation with our own earning and obedience is suppressed, suddenly nothing stands between us and God, and we finally have the freedom to simply say, 'Lord, help me, a sinner!' Here the relationship is clear: He comes to us in our hour of need, and sits by our side, to let us know we belong to His love. \n—Jeff Hual"

It’s good news on a personal level, and they think about the changes they could make in their life, and suddenly they’ve never felt so gung-ho about anything, ever. \n\tAnd then it wears off, usually after exactly three months. They find themselves slipping back into all the old ways of thinking and being. It’s a letdown because they feel as though their change of heart had been genuine, but it’s also a letdown because they feel that if it had been a genuine saving experience, it should have lasted.\n\tBy this time, they’ve begun to feel guilty, they’ve begun to wonder if the God that sent His Son down is pretty upset with His down-payment, because they’re certainly not holding up their end of the arrangement. They might worry if they ever genuinely felt anything at all. Surely this feeling is only exacerbated on Sundays, where they come face-to-face with a room full of veteran churchgoers who are, from the looks of it, definitely better people. \n\tMaybe this was you, maybe it still is.

There are far too many Christians offering the love of the Gospel as a conditional bait-and-switch, but there is nothing conditional about what Christ did for you on the cross.\n\tWe will always share Paul’s experience in Romans 7 where our thoughts and behaviors do not match up with our new heart, but we will also share in the comfort that he finds in the unconditional love and mercy of God.\n—Mike Burton"

Surely, I thought, Christianity has to offer more hope for victory than this tormented soul is experiencing. Then, with greater frequency, I found myself crying out in desperation with the speaker, and as I began to see myself more and more aptly described by the anguish of the speaker in this passage, I began to question my initial commitment to Jesus or the reliability of the entire Christian message. I came to the point where this passage either described the Christian life, or I was not a Christian—there was no other option. Fortunately, I was not alone. \n\tIn the year 427, St. Augustine, referencing his earlier written book entitled An Explanation of Certain Passages from the Epistle of the Apostle to the Romans, completely changed his previous interpretation, he writes:\nIn [that] book I said: 'However, when he says, ‘We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am carnal’ adequately shows that the law can be fulfilled only by spiritual men, the kind that the grace of God transforms,' I certainly did not want this applied personally to the one who was already spiritual, but to the man living 'under the 'Law' but not yet 'under grace.'...I reflected upon this more deeply and I saw that his own words can also be understood about the Apostle himself...\nLike Augustine—and many other Christians throughout history—the experience of my life as the same one described by this passage exposed the depth of my own need for the Gospel and forced me to re-evaluate all of my prior assumptions. \n\tI could no longer view sin as a choice or action but rather as a more fundamental problem lying at the root of my life—even all the good things! I was forced to see the Law as that just and righteous standard of God that was attainable only through faith, and that by which I was still being judged to the extent that I lived 'in the flesh.' Finally, I saw that I had been living in a super-spiritualized reality where I believed that my 'flesh' was that which was evil and I was, deep down, a purely good and well-intended person crying out for holiness. What I came to realize is that my 'flesh' is the totality of who I am and what I do, and that totality did not need to be healed, but needed to be saved. \n\tI used to view life as manageable with a little help from Jesus. I was not aware of the depth of God’s love for sinners in view of what was accomplished on the cross. Now, the amazing depths of my enduring and constant need are proportionate to the heights of Gods never-ending mercy, and this is why, as counterintuitive as it may be, Romans 7 remains a bedrock source of comfort, security and joy. \n—Jady Koch"

A boy for whom orphanhood would come to define the rest of his life and inspire many great deeds (and films). I’m talking, of course, about Bruce Wayne. And while Batman may not be the most serious example, he certainly embodies the 'slavery to fear' to which the Apostle Paul is referring in a startling way. Bereft of parents to protect and provide for him, the weight of the world falls on young Bruce’s shoulders. There is no one to look out for him, and no justice other than that which he can make for himself; the only solution to his problems is himself. That he might respond to such a lonely, godless universe by turning himself into an all-powerful 'übermensch' makes perfect sense. And in our own little ways, we all seek to control our environment and ourselves in Bat-like ways. In other words, we are all functioning orphans. \n\tI once had the opportunity to watch a friend and his wife go through the process of adopting a child in the state of New York. When I asked him what the most profound thing about the experience was, he responded in the following way: 'We got vetted and they put us on a list of couples waiting for a child. They made it very clear that there was no guarantee that anything was going to happen, no timeline to go by. Then, one day we woke up and got the call. We went to the hospital and signed some papers, and our lives were forever changed. In a single moment, we went from being husband and wife to being mother and father. But more importantly, for us, this baby became our son. All this happened before we had even met the baby! And it’s irrevocable. There’s no divorcing a child. Come what may, that boy was our son, with the privileges that entails.'\n\tOne of the many beautiful things about adoption is that it is initiated by the parent(s). The child is a passive recipient and beneficiary. His security is assured by the efforts of a benevolent third party, independent of anything he might bring to the table, good or bad. And this is precisely what happened when Jesus Christ came into the world. He died so that we might become children of God—and he signed the papers in blood. He did not do so in order to be arbitrarily gruesome, but to underline the permanence of our adoption. Nothing you or I do or say can erase that signature. Like a little baby, our relationship to our heavenly Father is defined by our need and helplessness, and His love for us. \n\tYou are not the only possible solution to your problems.

		"verseText": "For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile... the same Lord is Lord of all...",
		"text": "In this passage, the Apostle Paul denies the legitimacy of a particular strain of categorization. He suggests that 'there is no difference between Jew and Gentile.' He wants to get rid of something that runs rampant in each and every society, and in so doing, achieves something incredibly rare. What does he want to get rid of, and what does he hope to accomplish?\n\t'Jew and Gentile' are racial and religious distinctions. Paul assumes that his audience is used to being grouped into one of these two categories. Either they are born Jewish, or they are not, making them 'Gentile.' Today, the majority of the world’s Christians are 'Gentile,' so it may not seem like a radical suggestion. But it was, and it still is. Paul is completely unconvinced by racial distinctions. They are, to him, unpersuasive and tertiary. They deal with things that are only skin deep. To his way of thinking, outside differences hold no merit. The human nature beneath the surface of every racial category is the same. All people, no matter where they are from, need God’s love.\n\tHe elaborates upon this same idea in Galatians: 'There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.' Paul is not content only to dismiss racial distinctions. He is also unconvinced about distinctions that have to do with prestige and occupation: 'There is neither...slave nor free.' Are you an investment banker? Are you unemployed? In God’s eyes they are the same; both need God’s love.\n\tThere is a saying on the East Coast of the United States: 'The difference between the North and the South is that in the North, the first question a person asks you is, ‘What do you do for a living?,' while in the South, the first question asked is, ‘Where are you from?’' You see, even after 2000 years, people are still very much hung up on this type of differentiation. What do you do? Where are you from? Who do you know? What do you have? How do you look? What is your gender? \n \tIn God’s eyes, these characteristics do not hold merit. They do not interest God. This comes as good news to those who feel, in some sense, that they do not 'make the grade.' But this also comes as bad news to those of us who relish certain achievements and qualifications about ourselves. In each instance, and no matter where we fall on the spectrum of pedigree and accomplishment, we separate ourselves from our fellows. People are either 'in' or they are 'out.' It is so unhelpful.\n\tAnd so, in getting rid of these concerns, we begin to see a picture of life that unifies. There are no distinctions. But there is equality. We all stand before God in weakness and need. And if you don’t mind the stigma that comes with being adopted, you will see that His love for you has given you foolproof standing, total justification, and an end to the games and putting stock in them. Thank God for this alternative, unifying perspective. \n—John Zahl"

		"verseText": "...for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.",
		"text": "As a kid, one of the rules of life was always no take-backs. This meant that once you gave something away, you could not ask for it back. 'No take-backs' applied to every case when a classmate gave away a valuable commodity to another classmate, like a pencil or magic marker, a baseball card, a finely crafted paper football, or the rarely-gifted Snack Pack or Hostess Cupcake. If you gave one of these valuable commodities away, there was to be no asking for it back. If someone asked for it back the offended party would simply say, 'No take-backs,' and that was the end of it. If that wasn’t the end of it, doom awaited you on the playground.\n\tIn this verse, Paul says that 'the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.' The gifts and the calling of God are not to be changed or recalled or undone. Basically, with God there are no take-backs... in the best kind of way.\n\tThroughout the Old Testament we see again and again that God gives these gifts to Israel and does not take them back. We see again and again that God calls Israel His chosen people and never takes that back. Many of the prominent leaders of the Old Testament are sinners, like Jacob who deceives his own brother and father, Moses who has a short temper, Samson who chases prostitutes, David who commits murder and adultery, Hezekiah who caters to the heathen—it goes on and on. And yet, in spite of their disobedience, God does not disown them. In spite of their unfaithfulness, God remains faithful. \n\tThis, of course, is not just the case with Israel, but with you and me, too. This is good news, because our life experiences are replete with take-backs. When it comes to the gifts people give one another, there are often strings attached. And these take-backs can involve things much more important than baseball cards and cupcakes. \n\tSometimes a company will take back an offer made to an excited new employee and offer the job to someone else. Sometimes the gifts people give one another are yoked to unspoken expectations and run the risk of being taken back. Take-backs often occur in relationships. In his song Lonesome Day, Bruce Springsteen articulates the heartbreak this creates: \nOnce I thought I knew\nEverything I needed to know about you\nYour sweet whisper, your tender touch\nBut I didn’t really know that much\nJoke’s on me\nIt’s gonna be okay\nIf I can just get through this lonesome day\nOn top of the take-backs the world dishes out, our own lives are also filled with 'acts of foolishness' that cannot be taken back. These permanent experiences of bad news, though, are overshadowed by the permanently good news of the Gospel: that out of love for all of us Jesus Christ gave his life for us on the cross, an act the Greeks of his day considered utter foolishness. But as Paul wrote to the Corinthians: 'God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom' (1 Cor 1:22-25). This wisdom, the stubborn forgiveness of God in a world of take-backs, will never be shaken. No strings attached. \n—Dave Johnson"

It also seems a part of our wiring to shake fists at God, feeling entitled to a free will we just know we’ve always had. \n\tIn saying this, St. Paul isn’t changing the rules of the game in some way, but describing life as it already is. We might feel duped or lied to, but the truth is that we never have the autonomy we think we have. \n\tIf you think about it, our lives seem inherently characterized by the rub between what we know we should do and what we actually do. Knowing I shouldn’t play with my dad’s lighter under his bed, and then doing it anyway, and watching the bed go up in flames. Knowing I shouldn’t let my sisters take the fall for said fire, and then doing it anyway. Knowing I shouldn’t lie to the police officer in front of my parents about the broken window at the school, and then doing it anyway. The examples go on and on. \n\tIf life is about bringing together the 'is' with the 'ought,' we need some serious help. It only gets heavier if you consider the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5). What about the thoughts you’ve thought, even about the people you love? What about the things you’ve said you would do that you didn’t do? What does your search history say about you? What about all of the people you haven’t really liked throughout the years?\n\tSt. Paul exposes our desperate need once again, and thankfully provides the answer. God’s plan all along has been to take from us this faith in ourselves, so that, in our daily disobedience, we find His mercy anew. \n—Sean Norris"

'Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.' Sounds easy enough. \n\tThe only problem is that we almost always get it wrong. We (1) mourn with those who are wanting to rejoice, and (2) rejoice with those who are in the midst of mourning. For example: 'That’s great that you got a new job that you’re excited about... But does it have benefits?' Or: 'Don’t feel bad about the break-up; there are plenty of other fish in the sea.' The world abounds with such instances. It’s the difference between 'helping' and just listening. \n\tThe 1956 film Friendly Persuasion illustrates this point brilliantly. As the teenage son of a Quaker family decides to take up arms for the Union during the Civil War, his mother is eager to dissuade him, citing the pacifism that is a defining characteristic of their denomination. But the boy will not listen. So mother turns to father and says: 'You have to stop him from going!' Father replies: 'I’m just his father; I’m not his conscience.' The movie goes on to affirm both the father’s decision with regard to their son, and also the mother’s personal adherence to a nonviolent expression of faith.  \n\tBut usually, like the mom in Friendly Persuasion, we don’t really think that God can work without our getting involved (as a third party) in a conversation meant for two. After all, who likes to be interrupted? The same thing applies to the dialectic that exists between God and the people that concern us, but with one noteworthy difference: God actually won’t let you interrupt the thing He’s doing in the life of your friend. Try as you might. Go ahead, just try to change someone’s mind by taking issue with their train of thought.

It has also been an opportunity to re-acquaint myself with the documentary and book Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys. It is plain to see, in the book’s diagnosis of children, the bondage to self-assertion rather than a will that acts freely through objective choice:\nWhen school is not a good fit for a boy, when his normal expressions of energy and action routinely meet with negative responses from teachers and classmates, he stews in feelings of failure—feelings of sadness, shame, and anger, which can be very hard to detect beneath that brash exterior. Unable to 'talk out' the emotional pressure, boys typically act out through verbal or physical aggression that walls them off emotionally from others, straining or severing emotional connections to the people and circumstances they find painful.\nI usually describe it to my class as the difference between a brain hemorrhage and a nosebleed. If there is a brain hemorrhage (internal) and its symptom is a nosebleed (plainly visible), it is always our first instinct to treat the symptom without regard to that which we cannot see. So we stuff Q-Tips up our noses and call it a day. But it is a symptom! Its status as outward manifestation is totally irrelevant compared to the brain hemorrhage that exists away from plain view!\n\tIt is the same way with the Law. Christianity has engaged itself (to its detriment) primarily in the realm of ethics. Good deeds. Like the frustrated boy mentioned above, behavior is emphasized and regulated with almost total ignorance of what is actually driving it.\n\tThe Law is love, and love is a disposition through which its manifestations arise. This is the kind of love that empties itself in love for God and neighbor. It is not a kind of love that we can generate; it is the sort of love with which He loves us. The interesting thing is that the love with which we are loved by God—one-way love—is what begins to heal the internal condition. Being loved, we actually begin to love through a touched disposition. In this love, the internal and the external are fully addressed in powerful ways. \n—David Browder"

This is why, in the Episcopal liturgy, we affirm that God accepts us, 'not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses.' God’s love is forgiving love, not a reward for good performance; it’s truly unconditional.\n\tIn 1979 Jimmy Senyah released a little known disco song in France called 'Weakness for Your Sweetness.' He sings to a girl he is smitten with that he’s 'got a weakness for your sweetness' repeatedly. She flutters her eyelashes, and his heart melts. It is because she is so lovely, that he loves her. I wish I could ask Jimmy, 'But what about when she’s not being sweet?' \n\tHaving a weakness for sweetness is not the kind of love the Gospel teaches, because it conditional. It’s there for you—as long as you stay sweet. \n\tInstead, in Christ, we learn of the compassion God has for us when we are feeling low, and stuck, and not very pretty. In effect, God has a 'sweetness for your weakness,' the kind of comfort you can only hope for in a world obsessed with keeping things even-steven. Sweetness-for-weakness reflects the dynamic that Paul wants us to have for each other, because it’s the kind of love God has for us. It’s the kind of love that comes as a surprise (Luther called it 'alien love'), and when we connect with it, the darndest thing happens: we actually become a little sweeter.\n—John Zahl"

It’s certainly no less tempting now to gauge others: in the work place or in church Bible studies, the everyday appraisals are everywhere. In the previous chapter, Paul reminds the church in Rome not to allow their familiarity with grace to become a 'stumbling block' to other believers—I shudder to think that he is writing about me. \n\tAcceptance is a word we value in principle, but we’d rather not act on it. Acceptance simply goes too far for our tastes: we talk about 'tolerance' or 'hospitality,' but to think of acceptance in terms of Christ’s self-emptying kind of acceptance is veritably repulsive. At every corner we are inclined to say we have earned our stripes, that we have merited the privileges we so quickly withhold from those around us. A pastor once told me we only invite presumption and promote despair when we impose metrics upon others. He is correct because the word 'accept' in 15:7 seems as if God is asking me to accept others as I’ve been accepted, and that acceptance isn’t one of my character traits.\n\tThe New Testament records numerous accounts when the early believers stumbled over this very same stone: Jew and Greek, male and female, slave and free. In fact this section is essentially Paul’s call for the Jewish believers in Rome to accept their Gentile counterparts, not as interlopers, but as brothers and sisters. The curious thing is that there is something about accepting the other that brings praise to God, perhaps because it best summarizes the condescension of Christ—to accept the other in Christ is to tell another person that we are just as shocked that God would welcome us. To view ourselves as Gentiles—this is still our stumbling stone!

In the first paragraph alone, Paul covers all the '-ologies:' ecclesiology, Christology, soteriology, eschatology.\n\tWhat this means is that right off the bat, Paul is especially concerned with the Corinthians getting their theology right. This is interesting because, to an outside observer, the Corinthians’ main problem is their behavior. The Corinthians, by all accounts, have gone off the rails. Later sections of the letter reveal that the church is riven by 'pastor wars,' sexual immorality (a man has shacked up with his stepmom), and spiritual arrogance. But Paul does not begin with their behavior. He begins with their theology.\n\tIn these first sentences, Paul reminds the Corinthians of foundational Christian truths. I’d like to point out two. The first centers around the word 'guiltless' in verse 8, which means Christians are, by virtue of Christ’s merits and death, guiltless before God. This is good news in a world where everyone is constantly keeping score. Have you seen Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited? In the movie, three brothers are unable to reconcile their own bitterness toward each other, the root cause being a total lack of grace and forgiveness. Instead, there is control, manipulation, and deceit. Their operating principle is 'an eye for an eye.' You hurt me, I hurt you.\n\tThe vast majority of human relationships are like this. In Christianity, however, God declares us guiltless. That doesn’t mean we stop being sinners. Rather, it means God chooses to see us through the lens of love. He regards us as guiltless. He removes the stain. And the grammar is important here: God is the subject, the one who acts. 'You' (and that includes you!) is the object; God acts, we receive the action. God will 'sustain you to the end' in this guiltless-ness. God is the one who makes you guiltless in His sight, sustains you in guiltlessness, and will eventually judge you guiltless at 'the day of our Lord Jesus Christ,' i.e., the end of the world. In short, God does the work.\n\tThe second thing to note in this passage is in verse 9 and centers on the word 'fellowship.' Paul sums up here the whole point of Christianity: God has called you into fellowship with Jesus. This, again, is another rebuke to those Christians who would say our religion is mostly about what we do. This is a big idea these days: orthopraxis (right doing), not orthodoxy (right believing). This is implied when Christians ask other Christians, 'How’s your walk with the Lord?' The focus is on what you are doing. But Paul here says that God has called us into fellowship. That is, a relationship with Jesus. A relationship is something based on love, not doing. Rules don’t operate here.\n—Aaron Zimmerman"

And that’s why you suffer or feel empty. So if you’ll just fill the void with God-shaped stuff, you’ll feel a whole lot better. \n\tI’ve worried if anyone would stick around if they had an inkling of what new life looks like 'after God takes over.' Contrary to what the majority of the Bible says about human experience, the collective consciousness is somehow haunted with the idea that new living destines us for financial stability, deep relationships, or glowing health. But this picture is unreal; it does not account for certain future pain and difficulty, nor does it prepare us to see that God’s chosen way is often through these roads of suffering. \n\tThe Corinthian people, much like us, are enamored of the mountaintop perception of theology and life—of moral superiority and health-wealth gospels. Paul, instead, fixes his attention to the crucifix, something he permits is foolishness to the world, but is also the wisdom of God. \n\tIt is true that in light of Christ’s sacrifice, we are guaranteed his resurrection, but this does not mean we have inoculated ourselves to the cross. A clearer picture of the reality of Christian life lights upon the counterintuitive-ness of the power of death; God disarms us by operating through death and resurrection, not through our multistep successful living schemes. While we’re busy twittering ourselves into a tizzy, God covertly communicates his power in the 'weakness' of the cross. \n—Matt Johnson"

There is an attempt to add something to it to make is more appealing and plausible—advocacy groups, intentional living dinners, accountability partners. Paul is careful to make sure this simplicity is not compromised. It’s not that Paul thinks these things aren’t good; it’s more that his prayer is that their 'faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.' \n\tWhen I became a Christian in high school, I was excited about my newfound faith and looked for any and every opportunity to grow deeper. My question was always, 'Now what?' I dove into every devotional—my favorite was this one with a bodybuilder benchpressing a cross, called Cross Training Manual. I signed up for mission trips. I participated in this Christian outdoorsman camp, culminating in a 13-mile run with a 40-pound pack. Though I may have learned some Bible, in the end I felt just like everyone else—restless, insecure about my relationship with God. I never felt that I was doing enough. \n\tOver time I started skipping morning 'quiet times,' but when friends in my Bible study asked me how they were going, I would tell them they were going great. I had done all the scaling I could do, but found myself feeling Jesus less and less with every climb. 'What was I doing wrong?' I asked myself. \n\tI think I had begun to believe in this idea of Jesus-Plus, the lie that I was supposed to try as hard as I could, and then Jesus would pick up where I left off. I believed that if I did my part then he would do his. Basically I began to think the message of the Gospel was true only insofar as I helped bring it to bear.\n\tThe Gospel is sufficient of its own, and its work is never finished. Destroying the old self that seeks to supplant the Gospel with our own efforts is the work of the cross, not ours. Our only confidence is in this life-saving message, and nothing else. This is what Paul means to 'know nothing... except Christ and him crucified.' \n—Andrew Pearson"

		"text": "Here again we see Paul addressing the bickering problems among the Corinthians. But rather than addressing the external behavior, Paul realizes the real problem is internal and theological. \n\tPaul knows that there are two approaches to life for all human beings. The first approach is human-centered. Men and women in this camp see themselves as in control of their lives. This is like The Office’s Dwight Schrute quoting Billy Zane’s character in Titanic: 'A man makes his own luck.' In other words, human beings have the ability to judge people and events, map out their lives, and control their destiny. Students at elite colleges positively ooze with this kind of thinking. This is the human-centered view of life. In the spiritual realm, this view is called justification by works: making oneself acceptable to God through good behavior. \n\tThe second approach to life is God-centered. In this view, people are seen as they are, flawed and broken, prone to compulsive acting-out. Like the Harvard student who plays a video game for 10 hours straight, despite the fact that he has a paper due and is already on academic probation. Or like the suburban mother who regularly spends thousands of dollars on clothes she doesn’t need. Or the executive who is a furtive alcoholic. Or the high-achieving honor-roll student who is anorexic and cuts herself. Or the Bible study leader who obsesses over pornography. Thus, unlike in the human-centered view, the clear thinking God-centered man or woman no longer places the burden of 'getting better' on the ones who are ill. The God-centered view knows that people need a divine rescuer—like sick people need a doctor—and that this never stops being true, even for 'serious' Christians. \n\tThe Corinthians are decidedly human-centered. As a result, as we see in this passage, they quarrel about their spiritual leaders. Since they believe their personal growth is their responsibility, they know they better pick the right guru! Paul attacks this view. He steers them back to reality: God is the one who calls, redeems, saves, and continues to heal. Paul says that he and his co-pastor Apollos are nothing. An amazing thing to say! Can you imagine TV preachers saying that? But Paul says conclusively: only God gives the growth. \n\tDo you feel like you control your closeness to God? Is your 'walk with Christ,' your 'spiritual journey,' all up to you? Paul says only God gives the growth.

I had never thought of it that way, but I guess I am in the same category. \n\tThe Apostle Paul, who calls himself the 'chief of sinners,' is speaking to the members of this community who have been defrauding and suing each other and then going to TV court to sort it out. He reminds them that they used to be wild and wicked but then were forgiven; he exhorts them to live out that forgiveness in like-minded love for others, but things don’t seem to turn out that way. \n\tSurely it doesn’t for most of us—within or without the church. Consider families: the bitterness harbored against an absent father, the coy manipulation of a six-year old to take what isn’t hers, the sibling rivalries that turn every exchange into a reflection of favoritism. Call it harsh, but it seems in line with how Jesus elevates the Commandments to their highest pitch: 'But I say to you...whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire' (Matt 5:22b). We exhibit in the most casual encounters our inability to forgive. \n\t'To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?' (6:7). We are a people shown mercy who cannot show mercy ourselves. \n\tAnd yet Paul writes, 'But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God.' God sent Jesus to forgive the unforgiving, to cover in love a people who cannot help themselves. He sent Jesus not to condemn them but to wash them, to make them clean. \n\tThis is the message of the cross: that when the weight of our mistakes comes crashing upon us, as it has for the Corinthians, God’s word to us is that He loves us still. Because of Christ, we are clean, even though, if we’re honest, it certainly doesn’t look it.

		"text": "In his 2011 book Thinking Fast and Slow, the Nobel Prize-winning social psychologist Daniel Kahneman wrote something very interesting: 'There’s a notion out there that self-awareness is a form of salvation, that if we know about our mental mistakes, we can avoid them...But it turns out self-knowledge is surprisingly useless; even when we know why we stumble, we still find a way to fall.' Kahneman is even brave enough to admit that his decades of groundbreaking research haven’t significantly improved his own mental performance. 'My intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and poor planning as it was before I made a study of these issues,' he writes. Wow. If an expert like Dr. Kahneman hasn’t been able to effect change in himself through self-knowledge, what hope is there for laymen like you and me? \n\tPerhaps it should come as no surprise that the Apostle Paul juxtaposes knowledge with love in this passage, subordinating the latter to the former. Knowledge, after all, is partial. There are so many things we can’t know, and that we don’t know, both when it comes to ourselves and to the world around us. And even those things which we think we know for certain can change. I was taught growing up that Pluto was a planet. But astronomers have since declared it to be nothing more than a large hunk of rock! \n\tNowhere is the 'uselessness' of knowledge more apparent than in personal relationships. We convince ourselves that if (enter name here) just knew how alienating some of their habits are, they would change. It’s our job to inform them when they’re chewing with their mouth open, laughing too loudly, blindly defending the hurtful behavior of their family members, etc. Such nit-picking and nagging may never work—it may even have a destructive effect on the relationship—but that rarely stops us from trying. \n\tThe Gospel frees us from the illusion that if we only knew more, things would be better. This is because the Gospel is not about knowing; it’s about being known. It is not about loving so much as being loved. The two are related, and in precisely the way Paul suggests. You can know someone and not love them, but you can’t truly love someone without knowing them. \n\tImagine if I locked my dog and my wife in the trunk of my car. After an hour, only one of them is going to be glad to see me. The dog’s love is unconditional, but it is ignorant. He doesn’t know what I’ve done. My wife’s love, on the other hand, is slightly more tenuous. She knows what I’ve done, and it can’t help but affect her feelings for me, at least for the moment. Perhaps we think God is like our dog, that He loves us as long as He doesn’t know what we’ve done. Or perhaps we think he is like our wife/husband, where He knows too much to feel good about us. The miracle of God’s love is that it is both. He knows us and He loves us. \n\tSo where are you putting faith in knowledge today, rather than the One who knows? Rest assured, it has not caught Him off guard. He loves you still. And there is nothing partial about it. \n—David Zahl"

These are common statements, and I completely understand the sentiment. How many times I’ve started a sentence with 'Why don’t they...' \n\tWhat we really want, though, is for our own values and actions to be validated by others. The problem with this thinking is obvious, but we often disguise it by couching our motivations in righteous terms. 'I just think we should be intentional about...' or 'We ought to be reaching out to...' They certainly seem like fair statements. Jesus commanded that we serve the poor, the orphans and widows—and so we should do things like serving in soup kitchens and loving our neighbors. \n\tWhat we often fail to realize is that sometimes, the soup kitchen is located in a church and already staffed by Christians. While wagging fingers, it is easy for our view of 'the church universal' to get very myopic. We forget that the church is much bigger than we can often see, and that it has many parts. If we are the left pinky, it is easy to forget that the eye does not help anyone by trying to be another left pinky like us. \n\tJesus has freed us from needing to decide what’s indispensable. Instead, in freedom we serve as the Spirit moves us to serve; that is always going to be different than how another is moved, and that is okay. \n\tJesus says a lot of things about how we ought to live, but with his commands we must remember his description of the Kingdom: 'So the last shall be first and the first last.'

The owner, a very nice lady, asked us where we were from and we told her: Charleston. She mentioned that she had grown up in Charleston, on Sullivan’s Island. My wife commented that I, her husband, currently worked on Sullivan’s Island.

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones enter to prevent the alien from escaping and save the girl (and the world). Will Smith says, 'It’s okay, Laurel,' as she is being held around the neck by the alien in a decaying fleshy Edgar suit, and Laurel responds, 'How is this okay?!' Will Smith responds, 'I’m saying it’s gonna be okay!' I jokingly use this phrase with my wife when we get overwhelmed about something. She’s always skeptical of this pacifier in the face of real problems because, she rightly objects, 'How do you know it’s going to be okay?'\n\tAnd how do we? The trouble with faith is that it is uncertain. We do not know instinctively that things are going to be okay. It is this uncertainty that stirs the pot of doubt for some of the Corinthians, who have begun refuting the existence of the resurrection. Paul’s answer here is that 'If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.' If there is no resurrection, we do not have hope, and our belief is ridiculous. \n\tRidiculous or not, worried or not, the assuring thing is that it isn’t up to us. What we don’t always believe is still objectively true; it doesn’t become less true because we haven’t conjured up enough belief in it. Besides, our faith is not something that we maintain or conjure up, but something given to us. Like everything else with God, we are the passive recipients of faith—God is the author and sustainer of our faith, and He will attest to Himself. This is what the Holy Spirit does in those moments when we ask, 'How is this okay?' The Holy Spirit reminds us of what has been done, that no matter what, God is faithful, and from that knowledge faith begins to spring.

Death is swallowed up in Christ’s victory, giving us the freedom of life everlasting. \n\tAnd yet we die. Everything dies—humans and animals suffer and die, whether by natural causes or natural disasters or cancers or famines or wars or murders. In wake of these deaths we feel worry, condemnation, shame, and despair. Though we strive against it, death always has the last word.\n\tIt is for this reason that, if we don’t pin our hopes for redemption on the cross of Christ, we are left to feeble strategies to fight the perpetual tides of death. One particularly odd strategy for dealing with death is seen in a piece of art by British artist Damien Hirst. In 2007, he unveiled his masterpiece: a diamond-encrusted platinum cast of a human skull priced at $98 million. The skull, cast from a 35-year-old 18th-century European male, is coated with 8,601 diamonds, including a large pink diamond worth more than $8 million in the center of its forehead. His explanation of the work is fascinating: 'I hope this work gives people hope—uplifting, take your breath away....It shows we are not going to live forever. But it also has a feeling of victory over death.'\n\tWe don’t need diamond encrusted skulls that give the feeling of overcoming of death. We need sin and death to actually be overcome. Paul says in Romans that 'Jesus Christ died for our sins and was raised for our justification' (4:25). This overcoming of death reaches all the way to you here, to the memories of smaller deaths in your life; to your depression now, your fears and insecurities, your shame for what’s been done to you or the impulses you cannot control.\n\tIn the cross and in the resurrection, God has taken sin and death. Though it may not be visible, Christ has overthrown them, taking sorrow captive and ruling over death for all eternity. Love has replaced darkness, joy has replaced despair, and peace has replaced fear.\n—Justin Holcomb"

Though his flock may fear or feel unworthy of the gift, He does not tire of doling out comfort for the afflicted. \n\tIt is easy, then, to believe that there are variations of affliction—but with God there is no pecking order. He doesn’t discriminate; God, by nature, presents Himself in 'any affliction.' This is something the Church experiences together—as we share in Christ’s suffering, we too share in the comfort of God’s love. This does not mean that affliction must be sought after—it comes as surely as we live, and Paul calls us to see that somehow these afflictions have been made Christ’s own. It is mysterious, as Luther puts it, that 'Christ our Head, makes our afflictions His own, so that when we, who are His body, suffer, He is affected as though the evils were his own.' \n\tPaul then describes how we are to use this experience of comfort to comfort those around us. This is something we’ve largely forgotten how to do. Though we’re needy of comfort, we often end up pushing ourselves and others to lead, as Thoreau said, 'lives of quiet desperation,' instead of seeing the freedom Christ has won for us. We feign the 'all is well' persona, perhaps because we want to draw from the well no more than anybody else. We naturally fear our own weakness, but Paul here is saying this weakness is all we need for the fount of comfort. \n\tThough it is true that this is an audacious claim, let us be audacious enough to seek this comfort amidst the afflictions of our lives.

Suddenly things can never be the same again. \n\tIt’s no different for the Corinthian church, but Paul makes it clear here that the natural consequences wrought by the wrongdoer are punishment enough, and the buck should stop there. He anticipates the human impulse to lord the past over a wrongdoer—an impulse we all have—and disassociates it from the message of the Jesus. As withholders of forgiveness, Paul calls the Corinthians to reaffirm their love for those who have fallen. That is to say, in the name of Christ, the rebuke requires a complete reversal: a kiss on the face, an embrace, a patient empathy in the process of recovery. \n\tSo where is forgiveness withheld in your life? When have you been the withholder; when were you the withheld-from? Perhaps it’s been uncovered, or perhaps you see no way it could be covered enough, but the wrong is there and you both know it. Perhaps the silent tension is punishment enough. \n\tThe house of God is a house full of those in need of forgiveness. Let us ask God to bring Paul’s words of instruction to us and to our churches. This will happen when people—starting with you and me—can be honest about our sufferings. This honesty comes from the knowledge that in Christ, forgiveness shall not be withheld. \n—Javier Garcia"

For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.",
		"text": "Paul has come to the conclusion here that the Law has done its job. How? Put simply, though the Law cannot cure the chronically self-inclined human nature, it exhibits human nature with crystal clarity. In laying our natures bare, our profound need for a Savior is laid bare with it. The Law is useful in setting us up beautifully for our own demise—and for the resurrecting work of an atoning God. Now the Law, according to Paul, having performed its 'ministry of death,' is set aside for the 'ministry of righteousness.' The Gospel, the eminently permanent presence of God’s love for humankind, is now here to stay!\n\tBut this is where the questions come in. Isn’t my faith a contribution to salvation? I am called to believe, aren’t I? What about my actions of obedience? Don’t I need to show God that my faith is real by how I live my life? If I love the Lord, I should love His Law too, right? \n\tWe have a propensity for these kinds of protests of the Gospel message, dimming down the bright end of our death in Christ. We prefer the control Pelagianism offers, the hope we might be able to contribute to the divine contract. \n\tIt is not abnormal to find circles in which 'salvation' means the admission ticket to God, but 'Christian Living' is thereafter the maintenance fee. In these circles Christianity—a faith based upon God taking control of your life for you—looks more and more like any other moralistic balance beam. Returning to the Law as one’s mettle testing—more than being a dishonest portrayal of Christ’s ministry—is fraught with needless hazards, leading believers back into the 'ministry of death.' In modern parlance, the return to the Law creates psychological burnout. It kills, and it cannot make alive. \n\tThe Christian is not under this penalizing and paralyzing power of the Law. The Christian walks under the umbrella of grace, covered by grace, and moved to life and faith and holiness by grace. This is the Christian message, the 'ministry of righteousness' that gives us hope. \n—Ethan Magness"

It blocks out the light and obscures our vision so that all we can see are potential judgments. Some of us wear that veil like a pair of glasses. Paul claims here that such a veil exists whenever the old covenant—the Law—is read. We don’t hear something beautiful and holy being described. All we hear is accusation.\n\tVeils of judgment exist most plainly in relationships. Maybe we’ve wronged someone or they’ve wronged us. Maybe they said something hurtful, and it got back to us. The next time we see them, a veil of judgment will have fallen between us, a coldness that prevents us from experiencing them in any way that isn’t laced with condemnation. We hear criticism where it’s not intended. Instead of 'blah blah blah,' it’s 'law law law.'\n\tI remember getting some uncommonly wise advice from a friend about a problem that had been bothering me. When I got home that evening and told my wife, she just stared at me. 'I told you the exact same thing three months ago!' The veils of judgment that exist between spouses (or between siblings, or between parents and children) are often the most intricately woven. \n\tGary Ridgeway, the 'Green River Killer,' was one of America’s most notorious serial killers, responsible for the deaths of nearly 100 women in the 1980s and 90s. Finally captured in 2001, when he was put on trial, the victims’ relatives were given the chance to express the pain and grief that his crimes had caused. He sat there stone-faced as family member after family member berated him. They called him an animal. They told him he would burn in hell. They wished him an agonizing death. And then the father of one of his victims, a large man with a white beard, approached the podium. In a measured yet warm voice, he said, 'Mr Ridgeway, there are people here that hate you. I’m not one of them. You’ve made it difficult to live up to what I believe: what God says to do, to forgive. You. Are. Forgiven, sir.' Ridgeway immediately started crying, and later that day gave his first statement that showed any remorse. The veil of judgment dropped, and for the first time he could see what he had done. Forgiveness accomplished what judgment—even the most just kind—could not.\n\tCan you relate? Where in your life, and with whom, have veils been lifted—and where have they fallen? When Christ was crucified, the veil that hung in the temple, the one that separated human beings from God—the underlying and ultimate veil—was torn in two. Try as we might to sow it back together, it has been permanently set aside. We may see the world through a veil of judgment, we may see others and ourselves through one, but God, when He sees us, does not. You. Are. Forgiven. \n—David Zahl"

It is a real human face, one that does not assess, judge, or condemn. It is the disfigured face that could have called down legions of angels in his defense, but chose humiliation and death on the Cross at the hands of those he loves.

And yet, ironically, this kind of self-orientation is entirely uninspiring, if not embarrassing to us, when brought to light. No one wants their narcissism unveiled. \n\tBut enjoying a story often means imagining yourself within it. Like the characters in the really memorable stories, we want to be caught up in something great, something outside ourselves—to be in love, for example. No one wants to see the story end with, 'And she left love for the big opportunity at Bank of America.' Even though we spend most of our time going after things for ourselves, the things that truly inspire us always seem to draw us out of ourselves.\n\tI work with teenagers in a church, and it doesn’t take much to see the nature of their internal struggle with religion. For a lot of them, at least, it looks like this: 'What I want to do' vs. 'What God wants me to do.' Freedom is defined as being your own person and getting to do what you want. So naturally, slavery is being God’s and doing what He wants. I remember having a similar outlook. And if I’m honest, I still do, even now. Self equals freedom. God equals slavery. This is our mantra, covertly or overtly.\n\tAgainst this mantra, St. Paul comes out swinging, telling us what all the best stories have been telling us—that the exact opposite is in fact the truth. God (and Love) is freedom from the slavery of self. Christ’s death, Paul says, has not only saved us from something but for something. The cross has delivered us out of death and sin and into a world of meaning and love, where we finally have something to live for that is bigger than ourselves. No longer slaves, we have been set free to live as we were meant to live, for him and for others. Through his death, we become characters in the story we always longed to be in.

The picture is to re-establish an original peace that once existed. In Paul’s writings, God is always the reconciler. The initiative is God’s, who changes a relationship of enmity to one of friendship, and this is accomplished through Christ, through his death on the cross.\n\tThe recipient, he then says, is the world. This means that reconciliation is comprehensive and all-encompassing. God’s reconciliation is done in forgiveness—by not 'counting against us' the amount of a debt we owe. Like late charges on a credit card for which we are legally responsible, God doesn’t post the debts to our account that should rightfully be ours. This is because Christ so closely identified with the plight of humanity that their sin became his.\n\tThis is our great hope—that Christ’s death took the consequences of our sins, that his perfect life is attributed to our account, that where sin abounds, grace abounds even more, that where we are weak, God is strong. This is what it means to be an ambassador of Christ, simply and honestly communicating our weakness, helping others with the pressure they feel to display to the world their infinite and paltry successes.

While Christ’s is the only crucifying work that’s ever going to save the world, Paul’s circumstantial crucifixions bear fruit insomuch as they make him more and more like Jesus.

The amount of vegetables Americans eat is less than half of what public health officials had hoped. Worse, it has barely budged since 2000... [A doctor involved in the study], like other public health officials dedicated to improving the American diet, concedes that perhaps simply telling people to eat more vegetables isn’t working.

Two blades were sufficient for shaving, and no one complained about needing more blades. Then, Gillette introduced the Mach-3 razor, with three blades! The Mach-3, a hit, stirred the pot amongst its competitors. As a result, Gillette enhanced its 3-blade razor by adding an aloe strip for moisture, placing the company at the pinnacle of innovation in the razor industry.\n\tBut to the CEO’s surprise, as he explains, 'the bastards went to four blades... Moisture or no, suddenly we’re the chumps.' What follows is his competitive reply and angry reaction to this setback: \n\t'Sure, we could go to four blades next, like the competition.

Well, five blades is the biggest chance of all.' \n\tWhile fictional, The Onion’s  story demonstrates a common captivity. I often feel that a particular accomplishment or experience will bring me the success or peace I need. I strive to achieve, expecting peace to follow, and often don’t succeed. When I do, however temporarily, like with the three-blade razor and aloe strip, success is fleeting and another obstacle arises, often immediately. The Law increases its demands through four blades, and its infinitely demanding character imprisons us. We cannot satisfy the craving of fulfillment. There is always one more blade to add.

Christianity has often made a mess of this gift of the Holy Spirit, turning it into a possession manipulated for purposes of worldly power. Once the Holy Spirit was given quite visibly, as when Christ was baptized in the Jordan by John or when tongues of fire were placed on the heads of Christ’s new preachers at Pentecost. This was needed because of hard disbelief among the righteous and unrighteous alike according to the Law. Presently the Holy Spirit comes hiding in the Word of preachers or, as we sometimes say, 'through the bare word alone.' This gives us what we call an 'internal' testimony, or voice that we hear assuring us, that God is pleased with us because He is so pleased with his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, who went all the way to the cross. That is, instead of hearing the voice of the Law saying, 'What have you done?', we hear Christ alone, who stands victorious over all other powers and voices that want to claim us. \n\tThis is enough to know that we have the Spirit, but there is also what we might call an 'external testament' to the Spirit’s presence in our hearts. We actually find that our feelings and thoughts are changed, since we now enjoy hearing Christ all the time. We stop taking our internal religious temperature and start clinging to an external word. Peace and certainty arrive to us as wonderful gifts that are unknown but for the Gospel. Certainty is impossible to come by in this old world. It must be given as the gift of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father’s Son. \n\tBut faith is attacked as long as we remain in this old world, attacked by all our old enemies, including Satan, the Law, and my own sinful self. The moment I hear Christ, Satan prowls about holding a mirror up to me, saying: 'Look for yourself, I see only a sinner, don’t you?' In fact we soon feel the opposite of certainty and peace, and the moment we remove our ear from Christ’s words, the old black magic of doubt enters more strongly than ever before. But here we have a great promise given in Paul’s letter to the Galatians. The Spirit is given to go to work for us in precisely these situations of doubt. He exercises faith in us, which means to apply faith when it is really needed in times of trial when we do not see or feel Christ’s presence. This can be the terror of the Law coming back and telling us what we have not done. It can be the tremor of death, which seems greater than even Christ can handle, and it can be the roaring of the Devil who tells us to stop listening to Christ and look only at ourselves. \n\tIn these times we have the promise of the Holy Spirit, given to us for the purpose of becoming our own intervening voice, taking our complaint to God in the form of a child’s plea: 'Abba! Father!' The Holy Spirit does not whisper; He yells, and yells louder than any law or sinner or devil, so that none can snatch us away from Christ. So what if we do not feel strong—Christ’s strength is made perfect in our weakness (2 Cor 12:9), and this means the Holy Spirit takes over for us. Our faith is not in our power to persevere, but in the Holy Spirit’s power to claim the Father’s ear and our own all in one terrific shout. The Gospel, remember, is a short word, and so the Holy Spirit never has to pray long, just loud. With Him on our side we can be certain of our salvation since it is Christ who accomplishes these things, not us. \n—Steven Paulson"

Through Jesus’ great sacrifice we can have 'our best life now,' or we can have that patience we’ve not had with our spouse and children, or we can achieve the things we couldn’t before. All of these things, while desirable, are not the impetus behind the cross. St. Paul says it plainly here in this verse: 'For freedom Christ has set us free.'

The modern vernacular doesn’t leave much room for talk of bondage or slavery, even on the interior, but it is undeniable that we are consumed by everyday concerns. The new baby, the dwindling 401-K, the knocking noise coming from under the hood of the car, the impossible boss, the impossible parent. Surely, it must mean freedom from these things. \n\tBut it is not freedom from difficulty, but freedom from our own sinful inclinations to carry on a charade. Just like the Galatians, we often think that the moment of freedom comes at conversion; after that, we just get serious about living it out. Ironically, then, our expressed need for Jesus has gone because 'we’re changed.' As Paul says in verse 4, 'You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the Law; you have fallen away from grace.'\n\tThis seriousness about our role in living it out only lasts as long as we can keep up the charade of 'the new man' or 'the good wife' or 'the patient employee.'

It means that our picture of judgment is wrong, and our understanding of how love works is wrong.\n\tWhen we love somebody, we give them the matchless and unique space to, well, judge themselves. This is what the world seldom understands. When you are loved, especially when you are forgiven, your blood curdles, your hair stands on end, you become ill, and thus you find yourself. Kerouac wrote that the 'book of pure truth is a bunch of mirrors bound together.' Love equals the 'space' for another person to see himself, or herself. It is a bracing look! Yet it has huge effect. You cannot stay the same when you really see yourself. And when you do see yourself, you actually start to become the person the Law stated you should become.\n \tIt’s like that moment in the Gospel of John when Peter, having denied Christ, is in the courtyard and Jesus walks by, bound, and he simply looks at Peter. Nothing more—no expostulating words, no accusation, no 'hard feelings'—just a look. We know it was the 'Look of Love' and that Peter crumbled and melted. Christ combined truth with love in his unique way. It is the unique way of the universe. Love without judgment, which is the only real love at all, creates self-knowledge, and actually self-loathing, which leads to self-forgetfulness. And self-forgetfulness instantly transforms itself into loving your neighbor as yourself. You merge, as it were, with your neighbor. He or she is no longer a stranger, no longer an 'other.' The stranger is you.\n \tIt is amazing how many of us still believe, inveterately and impenetrably, that judgment can create a change, that 'telling someone what to do' (euphemistically, 'speaking the truth in love') will result in their doing it. It is an almost universal fallacy, and it exists just as much among Christians as among everybody else in the world. Tell 'em to love and they’ll love. It never works. It always fails. What works is love, without judgment, which creates, eo ipso, the very thing that judgment tried and failed to create. \n \tThe world almost never seems to grasp this. After all, the world does everything wrong on purpose. But the New Testament says it. Love creates the thing that judgment could not, cannot, and never will do. Love issues in love.\n—Paul Zahl"

Want six pack abs? Just buy the Muscle Milk, or the Bowflex, and give the core-regimen 110% for some weeks, and you’ll see results. Doing helps us make sense of our achievements and results.\n\tAs delightful as it may be, 'Just Do It' mistakes how knowledge connects with willpower. We may want to do it; we may even need to do it, but often we can’t just do it—or at least we can’t do it for very long. \n\tIn a world that divides losers and achievers by the 'Just Do It' principle, the Bible says we’re really just the same. Abs-of-Steel and Sadsack-3am-TV-Watcher are really two sides of the same person, though they don’t seem to have anything in common. The same diagnosis rests upon the narcissist and the depressed: the Reformers called it homo incurvatus in se—humankind’s state of being curved in on itself, inclined toward bellybutton gazing. We are naturally self-obsessed, with our abilities or our problems. In all cases, our common denominator is self and the self’s acceptance. \n\tThe remedy, then, is to have our spines straightened out, in order to see that hope comes from without, not within. This passage is an elated riff on that hope, that 'in Christ, you are blessed with every spiritual blessing.' The answer is in Jesus, not you, who takes the pressure off. Jesus inverts the logic of Do vs. Can’t Do. In Christ you just are—without ever needing to have done anything. It’s already been done. So now, doing can just be a response to already being. \n\tWhat in your life challenges you to 'Just Do It?' We all have a longing to belong—both overachievers and self-loathers carry this anxious pride, and it doesn’t make either more or less acceptable to God. This is good news, that 'He chose us in him before the creation of the world.' His choosing happened before the willpower dilemmas confronting you today. You were lovingly adopted before you ever did a single thing. \n—Matt Johnson"

It is purely by grace that we have any faith and can experience God’s rich mercy. \n\tThis is a powerful passage because it articulates to us that Jesus Christ is not only our justification, but our sanctification as well. I was once in a Bible study where everyone was emphasizing verse 10, the good works that He has prepared for us to walk in. The question in Bible study went something like this: 'Okay, now that we have been saved, what good works do we need to walk in?' What we see in this passage is that God is the author and finisher of our salvation and the good works He has prepared for us to walk in. Therefore, since He has brought you to life, He will lead you to the works you can do. The question to ponder today is not, 'What works should I be doing?', but rather 'What works do I want to do?' Those are the works that are led by the Holy Spirit, and the works that He has prepared for you to walk in.\n—Jacob Smith"

The great American writer David Foster Wallace was not exaggerating when he described depression as a 'large dark billowing shape,' 'the billowing black sail of hell.'\n\tSigmund Freud theorized that depression is anger turned inward. Child psychologist Dorothy Martyn defines it as 'a loss of stature in your own eyes.' As we all know, anger at oneself and loss of stature can be justified. In my own life, depression has always had a trigger, usually a perceived failure of some kind—something as significant as the break-up of a relationship or as trivial as the purchase of the wrong kind of air-conditioner. \n\tStill, anyone who has been depressed, or dealt with a depressed person, knows that it is a sickness that cannot be cured by the sufferer. No amount of telling a depressed person not to be depressed—or explaining to them why they shouldn’t be—has any effect, other than often making the situation worse. In fact, the condition feeds on itself to the point where the depression can become indistinguishable from the person. To a depressed person, the Apostle Paul’s assertion that apart from the Lord we are not only in darkness, but that we are the darkness, does not sound so far-fetched. \n\tSo what is the answer? Can a depressed person be helped? How does the light get through? Sometimes nothing works, not even medication. But other times, the 'black sail' is pierced by compassion. Someone, maybe a good therapist or pastor, tries to understand and empathize with the pain rather than oppose it, and as a result, the depression begins to lift. Light shines into the darkness from outside, in the form of a loving and patient advocate. \n\tIt is not surprising, then, that Jesus is called the Light of the World (John 8:12). He was and is the very embodiment of Compassion, the one who died for people who have every reason to be depressed. But through his death and resurrection, we are made light. Our feelings, as dark as they may be, no longer have the final word. We can boldly join The Smiths in singing, 'There is a light that never goes out.'\n—David Zahl"

		"text": "When I first read this passage, I was struck by St. Paul’s joy in the face of imminent death. How can he say, 'to die is gain?' During a chaplaincy internship I had at a hospital, I had the awful privilege of attending an autopsy of a young man in his mid-twenties. His death was sudden and completely unexpected. As I watched the gruesome autopsy, I was overwhelmed by the reality of my own death. I recognized that one day I, too, will donate my organs to science. Or as Victor Hugo says, 'Men are all condemned to die, though the stay of execution varies.'\n\tWhat is it about death that can make people so uncomfortable? For many, death signifies their unfulfilled hopes and dreams. It means the end to what they hope would be a promising career. Death means tragically leaving loved ones behind. Death entails many unresolved regrets. In light of death, we regret all the strained relationships that are left unreconciled, whether it’s the distant friend or the estranged family member. We worry about remembrance, or even whether some people will be glad we’re gone.\n\tBut St. Paul says that to die is gain! Why? What can possibly be gained in death? For Paul, the answer is twofold. He says this because in many ways he has already lost everything. He has lost his career, his family, his reputation and all his financial assets (Phil 3:8). He has already lost almost everything there is to lose in this life. \n\tSt. Paul also says that to die is gain because he knows that death is not the end. But in some senses for me this sounds like a consolation prize. The idea of an afterlife seems abstract and removed from our daily toils. But as I think about it more, it is not that the afterlife is a disembodied existence with wings and harps. Paul knows that in death he gains Christ (Phil 1:23). He knows he will spend eternity with the One who loves him unconditionally. Paul’s death is not marked by the loss of his career or family, nor is it marked by regret over those things he did not accomplish. But Paul’s death means gaining the One who loves and forgives him. In light of God’s surpassingly great love for us, may we too say boldly that to die is gain! \n—Todd Brewer"

		"text": "There is an inverse correlation, it seems, between 'life' as we see it and Christianity. Paul here is rejoicing in the fact that he’s lost everything he had been working for in his life—the grooming, the scholarships, the social standing, the moral rectitude. He really rejoices he’s lost it. He says that losing all these things has actually brought him closer to the Lord. Everything he had been working for, he now sees, is rubbish, 'dung.' It’s not that he hasn’t 'suffered' the loss of these things, but the loss of them he counts in the win column, now that he knows a new life and new power. \n\tWhat if this is not meant to be abstract in any way whatsoever? What if 'losing' things—your edge, your cool, your sleep, your touch, your marbles, your car keys—really, in the most straightforward sense, brings one closer to the heart of God? What if death and suffering are, quite literally, the places of 'the fellowship' and the groundwork for 'the power of his resurrection?' What would that say about today, your dreams deferred and your plans ahead? What would that say for the things you’re currently trying to 'keep alive?' What would that say for the things you’ve lost and continue trying to recover? It would suggest, as Robert Farrar Capon writes: \nWe never recover. We die. And if we live again, it is not because the old parts of our life are jiggled back into line, but because, without waiting for realignment, some wholly other life takes up residence in our death. Grace does not do things tit-for-tat; it acts finally and fully from the start.18F\nIf this is true—that loss and death are companionable partners with 'Christian' life and power—then the good news is twofold. First, the Gospel of Jesus Christ exposes all the chasings of 'livelihood'—the momentary successes, the daily primping and planning—for the hogwash it is. We are freed from its hold on our standing (and our sanity). \n\tSecond, and perhaps more beautifully, our losses and deaths are not absent of God, but instead access points to God, doorways to God. This is not a platitude, but a transfiguration: the 'loss of all things'—call it your 'low point' or 'breakdown' or 'rock bottom'—actually becomes for you that hardy shelter Jesus talks about, where 'the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock' (Matt 7:25). \n\tThe wild contradiction of 'Christian Living' is this unsightly comfort, that our firm ground stands in 'being conformable unto his death,' and thus falling into the 'power of his resurrection.'\n—Ethan Richardson"

You wonder what you did or said or were to drive away another person.\n\tSuch self-doubt isn’t irrational: the adage 'It’s not you, it’s me,' is false ninety percent of the time. One person often breaks up with another because of some perception of the other’s awkwardness or inadequate level of cool. This is a running motif in Seinfeld. For each of the countless girlfriends Jerry dates, he always finds some flaw upon which he fixates, and he breaks up the relationship because of it. \n\tAnd it’s true for relationships in general. One person wrongs the other in some way, and injury and guilt breaks the friendship. I know someone who, because of one critical word said at a Thanksgiving dinner, hasn’t spoken to the offending parent for years. It takes one mistake to ruin a friendship. Think of wedding invitations: no matter how small the wedding, if a close friend feels slighted, it is likely that they will not talk to the couple again. Relationships always break because of some form of guilt and accusation. \n\tSt. Paul says that we were alienated from God and were His enemies. Because we rejected His love, our relationship with God was broken—we had turned away, and there was no going back. But thankfully, God chose not to leave the relationship broken. Because of Christ, we are free from the breakup we asked for. In a world of relationships broken by guilt and accusation, God does not accuse us, but pardons us in a continual pursuit.

You are demanded legally, too: you must pay taxes, fulfill jury duty. It is hard not to view the world as one long list of ceaseless demands. \n\tBut there is another dimension to this bleak vista. Everything mentioned above only addresses the demands on us at a horizontal level, but there are the vertical demands from On High, too, aren’t there? It’s ironic that we will go to great lengths to talk about and work away at the horizontal variety, but the idea of a command from the Big Guy is just not cricket. Aren’t we the ones who get to make demands of God?\n\tScripture tells us differently; we are, as Paul writes in this passage, dead in our trespasses. In short, we aren’t really in any position to make demands. God demands instead, and God demands perfection. Jesus said, 'Be perfect, therefore, as your Heavenly Father is perfect' (Matt 5:48). This is the summation of the Law of God. \n\tHowever, God does not only reveal himself to us through His demands, but also through love, and He 'has made [us] alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.' Paul tells us that the vertical demand upon us, particularly what Paul calls a 'record of debt,' has been canceled, nailed to the cross of Christ. \n\tThe debt owed to God is not money or time or energy, but your very life. You cannot give it, but the Gospel—God’s good news—is that we are no longer crushed by its consequences.

		"text": "When Martin Luther was a young Augustinian monk—prior to becoming the great reformer—he was plagued with an incessant need to make sacramental confession. According to medieval tradition, grace was only available through the sacraments on the precondition of confessing one’s sins. Luther, unlike any of his monastic brethren, obsessed over whether he had actually confessed every single sin he committed, no matter how trivial. This greatly annoyed his fellow monks who were called to be his confessors at all hours.\n\tOf course, along with confession, and monastic life more generally, came many forms of making penance, and other daily requirements for performing rituals in order to stand in right relationship with God. Try as hard as he might, Luther found these ascetic disciplines never fully worked for him. In fact, they often made matters worse despite the outward appearance of his piety, which burdened him greatly:\nI was a good monk and kept my rule so strictly that I could say that if ever a monk could get into heaven through monastic discipline, I was that monk... And yet my conscience would not give me any certainty, but I always doubted and said, 'You didn’t do that right. You weren’t contrite enough. You left that out of your confession.'... Although I lived a blameless life as a monk, I felt that I was a sinner with an uneasy conscience before God. I also could not believe that I have pleased him with my works. Far from loving that righteous God who punished sinners, I actually hated him... I was in desperation... I kept my three vows devotedly day and night and yet I felt no repose in maintaining my duty so purely.19F\nWhat Luther recognized was that all this activity of austere self-denial had, as Paul says to the Colossians, an appearance of wisdom, in promoting 'self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body,' but it was of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh. In other words, neither the problem nor the solution are in our outward activities—in what one does or does not do. Rather, as Jesus Christ says, 'It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person' (Matt 15:11). The problem thus lies deep within us—original sin is inherent to our very nature, written on our DNA. Try as much as we like, there is no gene therapy for purging our nature.\n\tUnderstanding this is helpful, not just theologically but also psychologically. There is no spiritual apparatus we can or must use to earn God’s favor. Believing otherwise will lead us, like Luther, to desperation. Please don’t let me be misunderstood: Yes, disciplines like fasting, or Bible reading, or yoga, or the newest trends of veganism, all have value. Too often, though, we pervert these 'disciplines' into misguided technologies for preventing sin and earning God’s grace.\n\tThankfully God does not operate by 'helping those who help themselves'—a popular aphorism not from Scripture but from Ben Franklin. Rather, God helps wretches, like Luther, and me, and you, who cannot help themselves. I repeat: God helps those who cannot help themselves. He did so, is doing so, and will do so through Jesus Christ, the Righteous. Thanks be to God!\n—Matthew C. Schneider"

Though we’re buried under tons of hopeless solutions from the self-help sector, Paul outlines God’s model of the universe: we Christians do not do for ourselves, but God does for us. \n\tOne of my friends, who went to a well-known fundamentalist college in the South, recounted (bitterly) the way he was appealed to 'recommit' at almost every chapel service. It got to the point where students did not even know why they walked down to the altar, time after time. I wonder how many of the students still worship on a regular basis after four years of high-intensity pleading from the school figurehead and numerous guest speakers during those chapel services. \n\tSuch counterexamples of Christ’s uninhibited acceptance help me consider the radical nature of the Gospel all over again. Paul begins this benediction in verse 23: 'May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.' What is so striking here is that Paul bypasses the can-do in you and me. This is a word of assurance that people like us need to hear over and over again—God Himself will sanctify you, every part of you; He will keep you together. \n—Dylan Potter"

		"text": "The best definition of sanctification is 'the art of getting used to justification,' as Gerhard Forde says. It is the art of understanding that I no longer rely on myself or my performance in order to be loved and accepted. It is the art of leaving behind the old regime of 'If... then' and getting used to the new world of 'Because... therefore.' \n\tSanctification is saying good-bye to the thought that 'If I keep engaging in this or that sin, then I’m a bad Christian,' and hello to 'God has forgiven all my sin and taken away all condemnation; therefore there is nothing I can do to make Him love me more or less, and there is nothing that I can do to get in His way of transforming me into the image of his Son.'\n\tAnd the best news is that sanctification is by the Spirit; it is not by you or your discipline or your effort. As Paul says, sanctification is by the Spirit and is triggered by belief in the truth. Every day, the Spirit sanctifies us by the renewing truth of the Gospel. And what is this truth that sanctifies?\n\tWill Campbell, a desegregationist who lived in the South during the sixties, understood the truth that sanctifies. An agnostic once asked Campbell the following question: 'In ten words or less, what’s the Christian message?' His quick answer was, 'We’re all bastards, but God loves us anyway.' \n\tThe more Campbell reflected on his knee-jerk answer, the more he liked it. We are not born children of God; because of sin we are born enemies of God. Yet God wasn’t content to leave us bastardized—He sent his own Son to take on bastard status so that you and I could be adopted as sons and daughters of God.\n\tAll this Gospel saving was thought up by God, executed by God, signed, sealed and delivered by God—100 percent of it, leaving 0 percent for the bastards, if you do your math. This is justification and sanctification by the Spirit. Since our will is bound and, as the 1928 Book of Common Prayer says, 'we have no health in us,' then we must look completely outside ourselves for help. And God is the helper of the helpless. He does not help those who help themselves, but those who cannot help themselves. \n\tThis is the Gospel of the God 'who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace.' It is the only message worth getting used to. \n—Paul Walker"

Suffering gives a knee-jerk propensity to fixes—I want it to stop, and I want it to stop now. With another’s suffering, I want to be sensitive to their needs and I want to 'allow room,' but I don’t want it to take long.\n\tDo you find this to be true? In the presence of a breakdown, what do you do? Of course we do not want our loved ones to suffer, but more often than not we are less concerned with their comfort level and more focused on our own. It’s like the classic scenario played out in the amazing 1980 movie Airplane!, during which a woman begins to become hysterical, and the passengers line up, one by one, to literally smack some sense into her. Some just use their hands, but others brandish bats, crowbars, boxing gloves, etc. While dark, this is a true illustration of how people suffering around us make us feel. In Airplane!, they just want her to shut up; otherwise, they all might begin to consider the danger they are all faced with.\n\tWe want to quiet down the outward sign of pain and suffering because it is an all-too-painful reminder of where we, too, live, at least at some point or other. It is too great a thing for us to face. But this is where the rubber meets the road with Christianity—it is what makes it matter in everyday life. In the midst of suffering and pain, when we want to simply stamp down whatever is boiling over, we can know that God Himself will direct our hearts to His love and faithfulness. He will be the one to give an answer to our problem.\n—Sean Norris"

Peace does not exist inside of us, nor can we fabricate it. Second, this implies that we need to be given peace. \n\tWe would all like to think of ourselves as peaceful people, but on most mornings, our minds are a clutter of things to do and fears to keep at bay. Here believers in Christ are reassured that they can have peace in every situation, but do we really feel that way in light of an economic recession? In light of continued global strife? In light of our child’s weekend drinking? In light of our deadlines? In light of our most criminal thoughts and actions? Or even in light of this passage, which tells us we should feel peace? \n\tWe don’t have peace because we worry; we worry because we are afraid. We are afraid that we will be condemned. Whether it be the standards at work, a father’s expectations, the ideal weight, or the Ten Commandments, we are terrified of falling short. In his book Who Will Deliver Us?, Paul Zahl writes that 'It is possible to deduce that the long chronicle of ‘man’s inhumanity to man’ has roots in an aggregate of personal imprisonments from fear that bind everyone who has ever been born' (15). Fear drives us to fight both against each other and against ourselves. \n\tOn the night of his betrayal, Jesus says to his disciples, 'Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid' (John 14:27). Jesus speaks this to people who have good reason to fear. But Jesus has not come to condemn them or us, but to save us, to give us the very peace he has with God. Jesus comes and extinguishes our fear with God’s love for us. There is no sin he hasn’t forgiven. There is no fight he hasn’t overcome. \n—Kate Norris"

We do not need to be told by others that we have messed up, lost favor or fallen short. Instead we need to be loved and supported there, in the midst of the failures. The birth of a loving relationship is so amazing because it is not tethered to achievement. When you are loved as you are—scars and demotions and all—you find that there is nothing more freeing. \n\tThe Apostle Paul reminds his young apprentice Timothy of the beginning of his own relationship with Jesus. It had nothing to do with performance, prayer, or perseverance—or any of the other descriptions fitting a 'healthy relationship' with God, for that matter. Paul didn’t love Jesus or pray to Jesus; instead, he was persecuting Jesus. In the light of God’s eyes, Paul deserved judgment. Instead, Jesus met Paul on the road, and Paul received the overflow of mercy.\n\tBeing a Christian is not based on performance standards, which is why Paul can tell Timothy that the Gospel is the most important thing to remember. We do not become Christians, nor do we remain Christians, based upon what we do. Instead, we are told, 'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.'

We expect our spouse to meet all our needs, and when they don’t, we are resentful. We expect the church to be a functional, loving institution, and when it isn’t, we are resentful. Yet resentment is useless, like a weapon aimed at a target that always, somehow, boomerangs back at the shooter. And over time, resentment can turn into bitterness, or worse, hate. \n\tWhen we resent other people, we stop communicating with them. We hold back. We avoid them. When we resent institutions, we rebel against them. Resentment is relationship poison. Yet we don’t just resent other people or institutions. We resent ourselves when we fail to meet our own expectations or standards. One shorthand for depression, after all, is 'anger turned inward.' So what’s the answer? Reason certainly doesn’t seem to make much of a difference. That is, people are seldom argued out of their anger. Anger is fundamentally irrational. Just think about fighting in sports. No, for resentment to dissipate, something has to happen.\n\tWhen Paul talks about Christ as a ransom for all, as our mediator, he is pointing to Christ as the end of expectation. God’s expectation has been met in Christ. In other words, judgment has been removed as a factor in the way we relate to God. This is what it means to be reconciled, that the Father now resents none of us, ever. \n\tSo where is resentment holding you hostage? Where is it blocking your communication with other people? With God? Our resentments are not binding. Our anger has been nailed to a cross. The channel is open, and we can lift up 'holy hands without anger' or resentment.\n—David Zahl"

There isn’t much in the track listing that gives an indication about munitions, though, or becoming a member of your local bomb squad; but if you were sucker enough to buy the, ahem, 'Deluxe' Edition disc, you’ll find an actual epigraph. 'I am death, the mighty destroyer of the world'—a phrase taken and paraphrased by Oppenheimer on the first test of the atomic bomb in 1945. The album, written largely on the heels of the death of Bono’s father, is about dismantling death.\n\tWhich brings us, not surprisingly, squarely to Paul’s opening words to Timothy: 'This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death...' I am struck by how bald that phrase stands—Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, the One Who Was Slain, The Destroyer of the Destroyer of the World. \n\tFor Paul, this changes everything, as the letter starts here and works backward. Fear not, do not be ashamed, join with me in suffering. Just as we didn’t do anything to destroy death, nothing shall happen to us in life or death now; the power of God shall prevail. We know the end of the story, even as we are in its midst—this is the basis of our hope. \n\tHow is death, the atomic bomb, dismantled?

Death has been destroyed, and it is not our end; immortality has been given in its stead. Love will be the last word of our history, written in arrears. As Paul wrote another time, 'For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face.'

We think that life after the cross is somehow different than it was before we first heard the message of grace. We think that now we will be able to do what we could not before. 'Hey, thanks for the help. I’ve got it from here.' But we are prone to the same wickedness as those who are not in Christ. Believers and non-believers alike are in the same bag. For Paul there are no such categories as 'good people' and 'bad people;' there are just people, all capable and guilty of the same faults. \n\tThink of what Paul says in Romans 3, 'No one seeks after God. There is none righteous. No, not one.' All of us are bad. If our works made us good or worthy in some way, then we would not need salvation anyhow. We would not need mercy. But Paul clearly shows that we did and still do. The point here is that Paul is turning our attention away from ourselves and onto God. \n\tDo you ever have this problem, the so-self-focused-I-lost-all-perspective problem? It seems first-nature to think everything is up to us, even if the problems we face are too big. Every day presents tons of things that warrant worry or concern, from catching the subway to getting dinner ready, and we get in over our heads. But innately we believe we must break through it—heads down, push forward. \n\tPaul points elsewhere. Taking our eyes off of ourselves—all the ill motives and vain attempts—he reminds us of God’s mercy. He takes our everyday despair and focuses the everyday upon God’s merciful action toward us.\n\tThis pointing away from ourselves to the mercy of God is our hope. We stand on the receiving end of God’s undeserved grace. Looking inward, who we were before conversion and who we are now is just the same.

For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.",
		"text": "One of the ways God bestows grace is by refreshing us continually through other saints, or fellow believers, in Christ Jesus. We should venture an understanding of how this is even possible, given that so much of the time 'being refreshed' —that is, 'fellowship' —seems so stultified by bitter clashes, rampant judgmentalism and political nonsense. \n\tPaul begins these verses by stressing his thankfulness toward Philemon, specifically because of his love and faith in Jesus. The second part of this sentence has been translated various ways but, it seems to me Paul is indicating that a certain amount of faith is required when dealing with the saints. That is, we have to believe that beyond what we may see in a passing conversation or e-mail, God is working through us and in us. Despite how impossible it may seem, we have to dare to believe and to act in the belief that God is active in all of His broken vessels. \n\tThis is important to keep in mind, because who doesn’t cringe over certain aspects of church life, if not every aspect of it? Remember Anne Rice? How she renounced the Church and Christianity altogether while still claiming to be 'committed to Christ,' and how millions of people on the internet championed her cause? Whether it’s the quibbles over music, the opinionated who won’t stop politicizing the weekly Bible study, or those people who just don’t 'get it,' Paul urges us to hope against hope. This regard for the church—seeing the Church as one sees oneself—is a disposition of the heart that only God can create and foster. \n\tThough it is a dysfunctional family—a family that wishes it were not a family sometimes—I, for one, would not be a Christian if it were not for certain refreshing brothers and sisters. When I had just about had it with everything, and nearly 'pulled an Anne Rice,' God provided people who loved me rightly, as if God knew the exact right people, at the right time, when I most needed it. The funny thing is, once this happened, and when it happens in general, I began to believe again that God works in His Church, and I was drawn to love it despite its frequent ugliness. By no means does this mean that I don’t struggle with the Church or its members. Au contraire! But God refreshes me in opportune times through special people, to show how the wholeness of the Gospel includes a love and faith for the saints.

None of us knew his real name, but we knew he had been a major in the U.S. Army and was a veteran of World War II. Everyone looked up to him. A widower of average height, thin and wiry, he always wore the same tweed jacket and fedora every single Sunday. During the school year on Sundays after church, Maj would treat any middle and high school students to the all-you-could-eat buffet at Shakey’s Pizza Parlor in Annandale (I don’t think it’s there anymore). Parents would drop us off at Shakey’s after church and pick us up an hour or two later. As a middle school student with a metabolism through the roof, I was in heaven. While we were eating, Maj would smile and walk around the tables, talking to each of us, cutting up with us. He paid for all of us—the buffet, the drinks, all of it his treat. I thought there had to be a catch, but there was no catch. Maj welcomed us and paid for everything.\n\tPhilemon had a slave named Onesimus, who had stolen from him and run away to visit Paul in prison. Apparently Paul led Onesimus to become a Christian, because he refers to him as 'my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.' Paul wrote his letter to Philemon to encourage him to welcome Onesimus back. It is a personal recommendation letter similar to the recommendation letters that I find myself writing each year for students applying for college or seminary, a personal letter on someone else’s behalf. In fact, Paul encourages Philemon to welcome back Onesimus not as a slave, but rather as 'a beloved brother.' \n\tThis kind of prodigal welcome is a defining characteristic of Jesus’ ministry. Throughout Scripture, Jesus warmly welcomes sinners before they even think about getting their act together, because he knows they can never get their act together. Jesus welcomes sinners with open arms, open arms that are later stretched and affixed to a cross. Paul is encouraging Philemon to welcome Onesimus back, though he has run away and stolen, and to welcome him back as a brother.\n\tJesus’ welcoming sinners is a major part of the Gospel, but it is not the entire Gospel, and in his letter to Philemon Paul not only urges him to welcome Onesimus back as a brother, but he also continues: 'If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it.'\n\tPaul knows that the issues of running away and theft cannot be overlooked or brushed aside, but must be dealt with head on. Paul does not ask Philemon to overlook the ways Onesimus has wronged him. Paul does not ask him to let bygones be bygones or to 'just let it go.' Instead, Paul takes Onesimus’ burden upon himself: 'If he has wronged you in any way,' he tells Philemon, 'or owes you anything, charge that to my account.' Like Maj, Paul does not expect Onesimus to pay the price himself (or to want to), but takes care of all of it. The message of the cross is no different—not only does Jesus welcome sinners, but also he takes the burden of all the ways we have wronged God upon himself, and he pays everything owed. And he did this for sinners—'while we were still sinners,' God proves his love for us once and for all in Jesus’ death on the cross (Rom 5:8). \n—Dave Johnson"

But what about when the ante is upped, and one offers to place something more substantial on their account?\n\tThere’s a short story by Walter Wangerin called 'Ragman.' The Ragman goes around exclaiming, 'Rags! Rags! New rags for old!,' strangely absorbing the addiction of the alcoholic when he exchanges blankets with him, and putting on the lame arm of the disabled man as his own when they exchange jackets. It was as if 'the hopes and fears of all the years' rested on this sin-eater, this John Coffey. \n\tIn a display of understatement and courage in two parts, Paul befriends the runaway slave of Philemon, whose name is Onesimus: to run away from one’s service as a slave was an offense punishable by death. Remarkably, Paul—in full knowledge of this offense—asks that the punishment be placed on his account. Just as remarkable, Onesimus, having a courage that comes only by faith, is now the courier of a letter addressed to the one who rightfully has a claim on his life and his death. And still he goes.\n\tWhat comes off the page and shows itself, these thousands of years later? There really is no if to it; it is more certainly an as: 'as another does you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.' Paul assumes that we will both wrong others and be wronged by others. How can Paul—or any of us, for that matter—place yet more debt on the account? By virtue of our common nature, he has no credit-worthiness; his ledger is no cleaner or less overdrawn than others. Paul, like us, is so indebted that he could be said to have no account!\n\tPaul is expressing, in a real situation, what Luther expressed so many centuries later: 'A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.' Paul knew with a deep, soul-changing knowledge that his national-debt sized bill had been utterly forgiven by Christ, absorbed as Christ exchanged his news clothes for Paul’s old rags: Paul was made perfectly free, subject to none. No strings attached. Zero balance. That alone allows him to speak with such command and confidence as to send a runaway slave back to his owner with the word, 'put it on my account—I am perfectly and completely and wholly bound to this man.' Likewise, that alone allows Onesimus—a runaway slave—to walk freely back into the lion’s mouth, to what would be a just sentence of death. It is the peculiar and wonderful freedom of a Christian that ties us fully and freely to another; indeed, the only way we can be freely bound to another is if we are free indeed. It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.\n—Gil Kracke"

		"verseText": "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, where you fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years. Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.’ As I swore in my wrath, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’' Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called 'today,' that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.",
		"text": "This passage in Hebrews has a strong 'today' thread in it. Verse 13 says, 'Encourage one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you will be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.' Verses 7-11 are quoting Psalm 95, 'Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.' I think Paul is saying there are big consequences if one is not living in today: the 'heart hardens,' the believer 'falls to the power of sin.' But is the writer exalting a 'Live in the Moment' philosophy, which happens to be pretty strong these days? No. There is something deeper at stake.\n\tThe warning in Psalm 95 is based on a past event where Israel had rebelled against God. Psalm 95 encourages Israel, 'Do not harden your heart as you did in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness.' In other words, our pasts have an absolute impact on our present. If we fail to address the past now, today will bring natural consequences. This is a descriptive truth for human beings; it is why therapists and doctors and attorneys have jobs. We are shaped by our past, the present is always becoming the past (and visa versa), and the future is often envisioned by our quiet projections from these pasts. All this to say, the past is alive and well in us. \n\tHow many people do you know, yourself included, who have events and relationships left unresolved or with regrets? If these things aren’t reconciled 'today'—and in many cases they aren’t—they will continue to be a source of deceit and pain. This is why we need the Gospel today, because only the grace of God can touch those past places we cannot return to or resurrect. Pain often doesn’t go, but the peace of Jesus Christ can and will be present in, over, and within that past. \n\tThis is also why your need for encouragement, as the passage says, is a daily need. This is not 'Buck up, little camper' encouragement, which is often vapidly disconnected and utterly useless in giving solace to your past. But it’s  the encouragement of grace; the assurance that, while you remain tied to the past’s shipwreck, Christ died for you and, in so doing, has killed your past and resurrected it to new life. These are the words of life today, and tomorrow, and tomorrow after that, words that balm the wounds of yesterday. \n—Ben Phillips"

		"verseText": "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.",
		"text": "He’s not The Mikado’s 'Lord High Executioner!' Though 'Great High Priest' sounds pretty impressive. The point of this passage is that the Perfect Man 'who has passed through the heavens' is sympathetic and came in peace.\n\tIn 1959, a pretty ragged little movie appeared in drive-ins that was called The Cosmic Man. It portrayed a supremely powerful alien from space that came down in what looked a giant spherical egg. The alien wore a dark raincoat, very large sunglasses, and talked like John Carradine. The movie’s key scene, however, revealed that he was really good. Even as the military tried to blow him to kingdom come, the alien cured a little boy of polio. If you’re a Christian, you probably can’t help liking this well-intentioned movie, low-budget as it is.\n\tOne of the supreme powers of Christian faith lies within the interplay of vast might and tender human sympathy. This interplay is heightened here in chapter four, because the 'Alien' has 'in every respect... been tempted as we are.' The qualifying phrase 'yet without sinning' was added to preserve the vast might of the Alien—He has to exist somehow apart from human nature—but the emphasis is on the sympathy. It is more important, for us, at least, that God be sympathetic than that He be perfect. The sympathy—for us!—trumps the majesty.\n\tThe application of the passage is simply that we can come to God 'in time of need,' and without hesitation. This is because God knows, from inside out, what need feels like. Can anyone really explain this? Phrases and figures of speech are sometimes used in theology to 'protect' one idea against the impact of another idea. They’re just phrases and figures of speech, though; intellectually defensive qualifiers, we might say.\n\tHere, the 'golden apples of the sun' (Ray Bradbury) are these: we can come to God 'with confidence,' 'we may receive mercy' from God, and we will find in God 'grace to help in time of need.'\n\tAll this is another way of saying, rent The Cosmic Man.\n—Paul Zahl"

		"verseText": "Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.",
		"text": "'I am not bound to please thee with my answers,' says Shakespeare’s Shylock in scene 18 of The Merchant of Venice, as he sues for justice before the Venetian court. He has a pound of flesh coming his way, and he is bound to have it. There is to be no mitigation, no tempering down of justice by some degree of mercy, no matter how eloquently Portia will plead. What is written is written; the law is the law. And that is exactly his assertion: 'I stand here for law.'\n\tGod, so long as He is God, is not bound to please us with His answers, either. The early church rejected the Marcionite heresy—the one which sought to prune the canon of Scripture back to a corpus that modern, civilized Romans could handle; gone the bodily and the Hebrew, remaining the spiritual and the Greek. So, too, have the moderns sought to redact God’s blood-wrath. The problem of all the blood in Hebrews 9:22 is not that God is unjust or even incomprehensible, but rather that the knife’s blade points here, at our own breast. Shylock: the name has since become a byword for severity, callousness and a grim insistence on the rigid letter of the law. God, according to the letter to the Hebrews, is a Shylock of the first order. To blood He is entitled, and blood He will have. \n\tAs with many references in literature, in media or the silver screen, we may see theological lines running through The Merchant of Venice, and they work, as they often do, in the language of the Law. When it comes to the Law, God is Shylock. Where God distinguishes himself from Shylock is not in the percentaged tempering of His wrath, or in making more palatable demands. Rather God, in the person of Jesus Christ, places Himself at the pointed end of the knife, as the object of His own blood-thirst. Jesus Christ’s new covenant (Heb 7:22, 12:24) is not new by way of founding some no-blood, sophisticated, spiritualized religion. It is new because Christ enters God’s full demand with his own blood. What the blood of creatures could never fulfill, the blood of God Himself does. Full demand, without mitigation; full justice, without temperance; full mercy through the blood of Christ—our sins not just rationalized, or understood, or accepted with the caveat of our improving, but covered over in blood, atoned for, and remembered no more (Heb 8:8). This is our new covenant, still signed in blood. \n—Jonathan Mumme"

And just as it is appointed for mortals to die once, and after that the judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.",
		"text": "It was not just shame and guilt that grew out of the disobedience of Adam and Eve, but death as well. God’s intent was that life might reign, but with sin, death came into the picture, along with decay and rust. And as much as we wince at the thought, we, each of us, have been grafted into the family that must face a last day.\n\tMy wife and I are Texans now. Any good Texan soon learns he or she has to make a kind of Lone Star pilgrimage to The Alamo, which we did within weeks of our move across the state’s border. The trip to this place, that 'nexus' point of history and tragedy was humbling—and disquieting—reminding me of my first trip to the USS Arizona’s 'remains' in Pearl Harbor nearly four decades earlier in my life.\n\tMost know the battle cry, 'Remember the Alamo,' and the very dark events that surrounded those hallowed grounds were, in a very real way, a kind of tangible fertilizer that empowered the people of the future Texas to eventually defeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto on 21 April, 1836. Strange how something dark, even perhaps ominous, can in some way be redeemed.\n\tIn the capture of the Texans, Santa Anna decided, as punishment for the attempted escape, that one man for every ten would be executed. Blindfolded, each man was required to draw a bean. If a white bean was drawn, the prisoner lived in jail; however, if a black bean was drawn, the prisoner was shot by a firing squad on March 25, 1843.\n\tThere is a 'black bean' at the Alamo with the appropriate 'write up,' and a letter that one young man wrote to his mother after he had drawn one of Santa Anna’s 'black beans.' It was daunting indeed to read the young fellow’s words of dread, of knowing his death was only moments away. But then he did hope—in a sense, pray—that his death would bring meaning to his life.\n\tOn Good Friday, we contemplate when the Lord draws the black bean. It is a vivid reminder that someday, each one of us will draw ours as well. There is a connection we need to make here. The passage from Hebrews begins to lay that out that connection for us.\n\tI would have hated to be one of those prisoners who reached in Santa Anna’s 'bean' bag, but I know that in a sense I already have. We have all drawn the 'black bean,' and there is no getting around that. May this be our prayer for reflection: \nGod is eternal light. \nMay I die at peace with my God.\nLord, stay by our door.\n—Russ Levenson"

		"verseText": "Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.",
		"text": "Whether we see it or not, we come to God as baptized individuals. This is something that, if forgotten, leaves us spending a lifetime needlessly currying the Lord’s favor. We see that Jesus even submitted himself to baptism, to the shock and protest of John the Baptizer. The fact that our Savior plunged his head beneath the waters is one thing, but what makes it all the more profound is that he intended for people like you and me to have 'our bodies washed with pure water.' \n\tIn the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?, two of the folk fugitive crew participate in a riverside baptismal service, and the minister tells one of the men, named Delmar O’Donnell, that all his sins have been washed away as he emerges from the water. As ne’er-do-well Delmar remarks, he’s even forgiven for when he stole that pig and was convicted. His friend protests, 'But you said you were innocent of that!' To which Delmar responds gleefully, 'I lied... and that’s been washed away too!' Like Delmar, this verse from Hebrews reminds us that our relationship to God is not based upon an ability to produce a 'sincere heart' or 'full assurance.' It is, instead, a cleansing—a burial and resurrection. God, not the minister, not the baptized, is the promise-maker during baptism; He promises to seal the weak and helpless child with His approval all the way until the child is a weak and helpless old-timer.\n\tNo matter what we might say about the sacraments, at the very least they remind us that our life is inextricably linked to the cleansing work of Christ. Our baptism is not a rite of passage; it is a drowning and rebirth. It is an execution witnessed by God and the Church. It is a testimony to our inclusion into Jesus’ death and resurrection. In Luther’s commentary on Romans, he wrote, 'When we are baptized into everlasting life and the kingdom of heaven... it is necessary that we should be baptized into Jesus Christ and his death.' In short, we relive the event in the Jordan where God pronounces His eternal benediction: 'You are my beloved child, with whom I am well pleased.' This is why we cling to our baptism, because it is a new and living demonstration of God’s pleasure with us before we could even respond. \n—Dylan Potter"

		"verseText": "But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.",
		"text": "There is this ever-recurring conception—it is a conception, nothing more—that having become a Christian, or given over your life to Christ, the problems of life will fade and the sufferings of life abate. Every 'theology of glory' wants to believe this. Every personal 'glory story' wishes intensely to claim this.\n \tAnd who doesn’t wish for and want a life without suffering? We reify the hope of a life that is purely positive and, more importantly, purely under the control of our desire for absolute avoidance of the negative. I understand this. You understand it. Everybody concedes the power of such a hope.\n \tYet this little text from Hebrews demolishes it. 'After you were enlightened,' says the text, 'you endured a hard struggle with sufferings.' The vexing, accurate words are 'endured,' 'struggle,' and 'sufferings.' Did I sign up for this when I 'became a Christian?' B. C. (Before Christ) life was hard enough. In my life A.D. (The Year of Our Lord) things are supposed to lighten up. The passage says otherwise.\n \tThe 'otherwise' is true to the experience of Christian sufferers throughout all time and everywhere. The Latin phrase is semper et ubique, always and everywhere. Universal suffering, spread evenly. Kerouac put it this way: 'We human beings are hopeless lost fools wandering mournfully in a general rain of woe that falls evenly everywhere.' Another way of putting it is Luther’s expression simul iustus et peccator, which is to say that Christians are always and forever 'justified and still sinner,' which means 'beloved yet always still human.' Even though you have given yourself over to the Nazarene Other, you are still in your human nature. You will never not be marred with suffering, transiency, and insubstantiality. Life is a dream, even for Christians.\n \tThe letter to the Hebrews underscores this. Even after your 'enlightenment,' sufferings came piling on, with persecutions and unpopularity. And to what hope does the author point? Where is the balm in Gilead, some positive spin on the recurring afflictions that inhere among faithful and convinced Christians?\n\tThe hope is of an abiding—lasting—possession that is ours beyond this world and therefore enduring. Nothing here lasts. Nothing here exists without suffering piled on to it. Nothing here has anything but the solidity of a dream. The abiding possession is love, which is our belovedness from God and our consequent 'works of love' (Kierkegaard) in relation to our fellow sufferers. The human works of love are the sort of electricity of lasting Being.\n\tWhenever I watch the legions of skateboarders milling around the odd enigmatic statue of Phillips Brooks by Trinity Church, Copley Square in Boston, the statue of Bishop Brooks with the hooded figure of Jesus behind him (I have read it was the last public statue in the USA to depict Christ), I am drawn to the text at its foot. I have read enough about Phillips Brooks to no longer worship him as a hero. He was flawed and mixed like everyone else. But the text in stone is sublime: 'He loved his fellow man.' This is the electricity that binds everyone together, and it is almost always the fruit of belovedness, the belovedness that comes from God to Kerouac’s 'hopeless lost fools.' Love from outside, conferred on people as they are, creates love from us to the others around us. As it did with Bishop Brooks, the darling of his age who died so young. But he really did love his fellow man. He had a better possession, an abiding one. \n \tIf only the skateboarders, who are Boston’s 'angry young men,' could hear and receive the words on the statue by which they literally whizz a hundred times a day.\n—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "When you look at your career, your marriage, your health—do you spend more time thinking about what you don’t have than what you do? Even a casual inventory reveals how little we are hardwired for gratitude. Or maybe you tirelessly compare yourself with everyone you come across. Other people become either an affirmation or condemnation of your worth, their very existence a comment on yours. Everyone has some situation where they are plagued by 'things unseen,' a place where they are in need of assurance. \n\tThere are differences among 'assurance' and 'reassurance' and 'self-assurance.' Oftentimes, religion boils down to a strategy of reassurance. Reassurance is a pat on the back. A pep talk. A hug even. 'Hang in there, it’s going to be alright.' At best, reassurance is a reality check, a reminder of how things really are. At worst, it is a pie-in-the-sky way of dismissing another’s fears or doubts. Either way, reassurance depends on the reassurer. It may feel good to be comforted for a while, but then the difficult questions settle in: How do they know everything will be okay? Can they see into the future? However well-intentioned other people’s attempts to reassure us are, the psychologist’s truism 'reassurance never reassures' has some basis. \n\tSelf-assurance, on the other hand, is a way of creating our own hope, reacting to those 'things unseen' by attempting to bring them into being ourselves. Self-assurance is tied to our performance and ability; as such, it works well when the stakes are small, or when we’re in our comfort zone. Not so much when we’ve exhausted every avenue. What happens when our best isn’t good enough? \n\tThe message of Christianity is one of assurance—assurance to people who are losing hope, drowning under the weight of 'things unseen.' Perhaps it is not surprising that the crucifixion itself looked like the opposite of what it was. It looked like a hopeless situation. When they saw their Lord arrested and executed, the disciples must have been acutely aware of 'things unseen.' But the resurrection of Christ seems to indicate that God is at work in the place where things seem most hopeless. He’s not waiting for us to do something, or to figure out the right tactic. \n\tThankfully, the assurance of Hebrews goes beyond our circumstances, intentions and abilities. It is based instead on something outside of us, something objective, something sure: the unassailable love of God revealed in the risen Christ. Where the unseen became seen, once for all, now and forever. \n—David Zahl"

		"text": "'Do you think people ever doubt that God exists?' This was the question one of my pre-adolescent children asked, as we stood in line waiting outside a barbeque joint near the Gulf Coast of Florida. Actually, when the question popped out, I was thinking about something that was kind of weighing me down—and yet, here one of those 'little children' that Jesus was so fond of telling others we had to be like. One of those was thinking on even weightier matters than me! It was, however, a good question, an honest one—and one that helped me get out of my mood.\n\tIn the course of my service as minister, I’ve often had that question put to me, more by grown-ups than youngsters. And of course, the answer (if I am honest) is 'Yes.' I think, during these times, that perhaps the underlying question is often, 'Is it okay to doubt the existence of God?' My answer is usually only slightly squishy—'It may not be okay, but it is quite normal!'\n\tWhenever I do get this question, I realize it usually means the one with the query is not running away from God, but toward Him—they are on a search. They have opened their minds and hearts to begin really exploring faith.\n\tIt is certain that much of what we know in Christianity seems worthy of thoughtful skepticism. But is that all bad? I remember a line that has been of help to me over the years—from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein of all places—'Without doubt there would be no need for faith.'\n\tIt is faith that gets us through the doubts. Doubts are normal. Alongside the apostles, we are in good company. But at some point we might want to remember Jesus’ gentle, loving, though clear reprimand to the most famous doubter, Thomas: 'Do not doubt but believe' (John 20:27).\n\tThe passage from Hebrews is known as the 'Great Faith Chapter' of the Bible because it retells the incredible miraculous story of God working with His followers over the centuries—and how faith played a key role in each case. But faith, like all good things from God, is finally a gift. It cannot be bought or earned, but only received. There are many things that may block our faith—our reason, our intellect, our reluctance, our fear, and yes, of course, our doubt.\n\t'Do people ever doubt the existence of God?' Well yes—I have. 'Is it okay?' Such doubt is normal—it is something with which we all struggle, but ultimately, we are given comfort in the place of faith. How does one have such faith?

		"text": "As Christians, we are encouraged to disregard the world’s standards of merit and favor instead a humble position before God. We understand ourselves to be the recipients of divine mercy, and are grateful for it. We come to digest the idea that our good standing with God has not been earned at all. Quite the contrary, it has been bestowed upon us because God loves us more than we can begin to fathom.\n\tRemembering this good news also enables us to have compassion and collegiality with those who have fallen especially short on 'the ladder of success.' They are not so different from even the most well-put-together Christians among us. Before God, in fact, we stand on the same footing with them.\n \tThis is an idea that needs to be conveyed, especially to those who will appreciate it the more for its surprise factor. Who is it that you should love, but do not? Who is it that you should care for, but instead have neglected? Have you, for example, ever visited a prison before? Perhaps God will present you with a fresh opportunity to do something of this variety, something that will stretch you beyond the confines of your daily comforts and familiar associations.\n\tNot only can God love (with enduring patience and steadfastness) even them, but so also do we need to stop justifying our lack of love, instead asking God to soften our hearts the way He softened his own heart toward the human race in sending his Son. \n\tA few years ago, in an attempt to engage more effectively with some very involved members of my congregation, I agreed to participate in a ministry-related visit to a maximum-security prison. I’ll never forget the experience of visiting a group of men on death row. I walked up to one of the tiny cell windows and looked inside. There, sitting on the end of a cot, I saw man reading his Bible. He got up from his bed, and offered me his hand through the little slot. Then he asked me if he could pray for me, and if there was anything going on in my life that I was seeking prayer for. \n\tHe took my hand and we prayed together, brothers in Christ, standing on the same stage before our heavenly Father, with that big metal door between us. \n—John Zahl"

		"text": "James here teaches us how to praise and worship God in our everyday lives, while at the same time warning us of a deception that is always lurking at the door. He has rightly separated what we often would confuse. Yes, evil and temptation exist in the world, and while God may work through evil and suffering, they are not a part of God’s character. Instead, James says, 'Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above...' People are often deceived about this, and it seems like the confusion comes in one of two ways: either we think that evil is part of God’s character, or that our good things come from below, from here—from ourselves, from nature, from the circumstances we’ve lined up. We are chronically tempted to believe, he seems to be saying, that what we enjoy on earth is not from God, but from ourselves. \n\tThis can open a whole new perspective on the mundane goings-on as well as the more extraordinary matters of everyday life. It is impossible to contemplate the entire scope of God’s gifts: the food we enjoy comes from God—Mexican food, Japanese food, French food, German food, Turkish food, Arabic, American. What is delicious and nutritious comes from God. God is the author of good meals, good meals with friends and family. He is the purveyor and financier of dining establishments worldwide! \n\tMore than this, the 'Father of Lights' puts people in our lives and takes them out; He displays mountain ranges and valleys and glaciers and estuaries and parks. The stars and the moon and the sun—the expanse of the universe comes from God. If you wake up to a spouse and children who are the delight of your heart—not necessarily today, but some days—they have come from God. If you are single and have the time to study and meet with friends, give thanks because such blessings also come from God. If you are more advanced in years and have had a myriad of rich experiences from your past, give thanks, because these years and experiences have been given by God. If you are working, in whatever job you might have—banker, teacher, real estate agent, minister, whatever—there God works through you in the world. If you are out of a job, give thanks that God sustains you. Whatever your situation in life, God is present in the good and perfect gifts He provides. \n\tThis is not to blanket the pain and difficulties of these things, or to say that one must always understand the vast glory of one’s daily existence, but James describes a Father who has made life from nothing, who will be this generous into eternity. Not only does God provide what we need here on earth, but also what we need when our short time here is up. \n\tThis same Father of Lights sends Jesus Christ, in his death and resurrection, to guarantee for us an everlasting hope. Whereas God now bestows universal grace for all people, eternal rest is promised to those who  have faith in Christ. So, as we read James, let us look up toward the Father of Lights, and wonder at the vastness of His glory in the things He provides and the works He does, both in what is obvious and what is hidden. Whatever is good on earth and in heaven, in the present order of things and in the way they will be—it all comes from the Fount of Every Blessing. \n—Javier Garcia"

Dazzling for me, most recently, was the Seventh Beatitude: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.\n \tThe association that flipped to mind immediately was to the pathology of anger. Non-peacemakers are angry. They eat the apple of discord, wherever they see it on the tree. And then division and dreadfulness come spitting out.\nI realize this sounds pretty psychological, but it’s the result of observation. It is as if anger, in angry people, is free-floating. It attracts itself to different objects and different people. It seems almost arbitrary. Angry people bite your head off one day, but someone else’s head the next. Maybe you are the angry person.\n \tThe Epistle of James, for all its reputation as being in tension with St. Paul, is pretty sound experientially. 'The anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.' I see this every day. My anger, somebody else’s anger, does little to rectify things that are wrong or unjust. It just makes me 'seethe' and burn, and build massive bonfires of resentment. Remember Hangover Square, the Laird Cregar horror movie in which the murderer disposes of his victim by pretending it’s a 'Guy,' as in Guy Fawkes, and places the body on a November 5th bonfire in plain sight? The limp corpse of the person he has just strangled takes its place, like another cord of wood, on the vast screaming blaze. Hollywood macabre, straight to the bone.\n\tAnger is like this. It’s 'another brick in the wall.' It is consumed, and it consumes us. In short, it murders. It does not work the righteousness of God. \n\tSt. James’ words are immortal because they are empirically, descriptively true. Listening is ever best ('Let every man be quick to hear'). Wise men say that he who knows the most says the least ('slow to speak'). Anger is human, judgmental, self-righteous, infected, and finally terminal. \n\tI wish 'conservatives' would take this aboard. I wish 'liberals' would take it to heart. I wish everybody would, well, just 'Stop! In the Name of Love.'\n—Paul Zahl"

Telling people to be 'doers of the word,' as in the passage here, sounds good. Until you try it. Then it runs out of gas. People become exhausted. They start to fight. Pretty soon the tires are flat and the engine is dead. \n\tYears ago, a nice woman in Scarborough, New York told me she had stopped attending a nearby church because the pastor’s sermons, coming down on Westchester County wealth for the sake of social justice and the poor, had simply tired her out. No one knew more keenly than she did that conscience pricks the 'rich' as well as the 'poor.' But the pastor was giving her no aid, no comfort, no balm—just guilt and more guilt, and innumerable Sundays of exhortation. \n\tBut hey, I don’t think James is talking about guilt and more guilt. I think, rather, that James is speaking a descriptive word, and a powerful one, at that. People who do not love as a result of being loved are like the man in the letter who 'observes his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.' Actually, when you see yourself as you are, you become almost instantly compassionate. Presto! It is really true. Every time a person takes just one look at his or her true condition, it discomfits so inwardly. It lights a revolution. It sparks the breakdown, which the Bible calls repentance. When you see your true self, it creates compassion, and this compassion spreads to others. You don’t forget what you are like. You are literally appalled, like Ebenezer Scrooge, into a change of heart. \n\tAnd one more thing: Anybody see the Hammer horror classic from the ‘70s entitled Vampire Circus? I don’t recommend it particularly, but there is one amazing scene in which the citizens of a plague-ridden village pass by a series of mirrors that distort the image. What the people actually see is their pathetic and vulnerable mortality, their thinness, their fatness, their reality, their sin. And the vision is horrible. And that’s when the vampire strikes. It is not corny. Yet there is no hope.\n \tFor us, the looking into the mirror is filled with hope. God, after all, made us and knows us. Nothing is hidden from Him. Yet He still loves us. That is the Christian confession. No vampire strikes at the moment of truth. Grace comes at the moment of truth. Jesus comes at the moment of truth. The presence of Jesus in the mirror is what St. James means by the phrase, 'the law of liberty.' The mirror is not judgment, the mirror is love. And you can’t walk away from such a mirror and be the same person. You act, as it were, automatically.\n \tOne day I hope to go to Birmingham and see the old broken-down church with a new lamp lit, and a new church bus. I also hope they don’t change the name.\n—Paul Zahl"

I have several close friends and family members who are in twelve-step recovery programs. Over the years, I’ve heard many of them 'share their stories.' One guy is fond of quoting a founder of one of those programs: '...we shall find no enduring strength until we first admit complete defeat.'\n\tI’m very interested in this concept of surrender, both as a theological abstraction and as a practical reality. Except for those aforementioned friends and family, I haven’t come across many people in life who understand so deeply the value, dare I say necessity, of giving up. But you don’t have to be an alcoholic or drug addict to relate.\n\tEver experienced unrequited love? Didn’t get that promotion? Turned down by the co-op board? Just can’t seem to appease that in-law? Pick a topic and go with it. I actually like this verse in James because it reminds me how futile my efforts are where it really counts. If I’m honest with myself, then I admit the standard of the Bible isn’t to try harder. It’s to be perfect. Right now.\n\tYikes! Where does that leave me? Well, possibly with the best of all scenarios. The law is good and perfect, but there’s also zero room for error. \n\tThe cross! Thankfully, the cross satisfies that completely onerous demand.

		"verseText": "For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.",
		"text": "Back in the mid-90s my family and I lived in Wyoming, where I served in youth ministry. We attended the local high school graduation, joining a family with whom we’d become good friends. The parents were so excited to see their one and only child graduate from high school. They asked me to videotape the graduation for them so they could simply sit back and enjoy the commencement ceremony. I was honored by their request and arrived early and took the time to set up the camera at a great angle, etc. I videotaped the whole ceremony, sure that I had done a great job.\n\tA couple evenings later we all gathered at their house to watch it. There was just one snag: while the audio was great, the screen was black. We could hear everything, but we couldn’t see a thing. For all my efforts in trying to capture great camera angles and the like, I had neglected to take the lens cap off. \n\tToday’s reading from the letter of James is a well-known passage about faith and works, and there has been much argument and discussion about the idea that faith without works is dead, that if we’re saved by faith and not by works, what does it mean that faith without works is dead? But in the midst of these arguments and discussions we forget to take the cap off the lens and are therefore blind to what stands at the root of this passage. The main point of the Gospel is not faith-versus-works, because faith and works have to do with our response to the Gospel, and the heart of the Gospel is not what we do for God, but what God has done for us in Jesus Christ. The heart of the Gospel is these four words... 'mercy triumphs over judgment' (2:13).\n\tOf course, our culture is obsessed with judging others. Many of the most popular 'reality' television shows are centered on judgment. One show, Toddlers and Tiaras, is about beauty pageants for toddlers. Little girls, three-, four-, five-year-olds, primped and postured and pronounced by their appearance. But it’s a booming business. (By the way, my guess is that along with the fast-growing industry of beauty pageants for toddlers, there will be an equally fast-growing need for child psychiatrists.) \n\tAnd then there’s American Idol, centered on what judges think about a contestant’s singing ability. Randy may say something like, 'Yo, yo, keeping it real, dog—you did your thing—you got pipes!—props to you, dog!,' while Simon may say something like, 'That was absolutely awful—I felt like I was watching a poor attempt at karaoke in a cheap hotel bar,' and Paula may say something like, 'I... I... I just... I just love you... you are a bright and shining star!' Of course, millions of Americans join in the judging and phone in their verdicts.\n\tBut being judged is not just a mainstay on television; it is an integral part of our culture, an integral part of human nature. Judging and being judged is a part of life from cradle to grave. We’re judged by our circumstances, by the color of our skin, by our neighborhood, by our school—how we dress, whom we marry, what we drive, where we belong, how smart or athletic our kids are, where they go to college, where we then retire... cyclical judgment never stops.\n\tThe good news is that God gives us mercy in Jesus Christ, because God in Christ took upon Himself our due judgment. The Greek word 'mercy' in the New Testament, eleos, is proactive and focuses on meeting the needs of the recipient, regardless of whether or not the recipient has a claim on the giver. In other words, when it comes to the mercy of God, God is the one who proactively takes the initiative and gives us mercy in spite of the fact that we have no claim on it whatsoever. God gives us His mercy, and this triumphs over the judgment of our works. \n—Dave Johnson"

		"text": "So I was at a Bible study, and the leader was going on about gossip. It’s terrible, she said, this tendency we have to gossip. Watch it! Stop gossiping, for heaven’s sake, and we’ll all have a much happier office and staff team. We all nodded our heads—I winced inwardly—and went our way.\n\tNot ten seconds had gone by, after the Bible study ended, when one of the participants walked into my office and proceeded to say terrible things about a co-worker who had just been present with us. Horrible things, vicious things she said of her colleague. Not ten seconds! ('Give us Barabbas!')\n\tThis little encounter taught me again, for the umpteenth time, that the tongue is a 'restless evil,' as St. James writes; but also that 'no human being can tame the tongue.' Gossip cannot be legislated out of existence, slander is always and everywhere around, no 'libel' laws can tame internet commenters or restrain heated bloggers. Speech is most easily corruptible.\n\tIncidentally, this is why the Eightfold Path of the Buddhist faith contains the promotion of Right Speech. 'Wrong speech' is everywhere. Right Speech is always a sign of goodness and un-self-serving intent.\n\tSo what to do with the description in James? If the tongue is untamable, does that place us forever at its mercy?\n\tYes and No. We will never live in a world where libel and verbal accusation, and the 'concealed hatred and conditions' (Jack Kerouac) that lurk behind most versions of human love, are not standing at the door of situations. But No, too, for love has the winsome power to restrain the tongue. I find that people who are (somewhat) secure within love are less likely to criticize, more likely to encourage, less likely to judge, more likely to forgive. When you are satisfied in love, your level of verbal contempt goes down. What we want to be is a realistic forgiver. What we want someone else to be is a realistic forgiver. I know that mean, malicious thoughts are always close at hand. Always. Romans 7 taught me this. Life has taught me this. But when I am treated with a little mercy, I definitely get nicer.\n\tI felt undone when that church worker came in after the exhortation concerning gossip; and gossiped, gossiped bad. But I shouldn’t have been surprised. I do know, however, that she was insecure, and surely not feeling loved, and precious. Maybe things at home will lighten up—or maybe heat up, if that is required. But when she 'breaks,' to quote Dylan, the love of God may do just the thing, and heal the tongue. Not until then, however.\n—Paul Zahl"

Using this idea, Peter underlines a helpless human situation. We, apparently, need a ransom—we don’t need a 'push in right direction,' we don’t need to 'follow our hearts,' we need freedom from a captor. \n\tNobody likes to think of himself or herself as a slave. We instead think of autonomy and strength. But if we’re honest, we can see how our lives in sin—our deeply contorted compulsions and propensities—are more like slavery than just a few correctable slipups. This isn’t just a theological proposition; it’s also experiential: in addictions, dysfunctional relationships, emotional impulses—wherever we feel caught or stuck. \n\tWhere are these for you? (It probably doesn’t take long to figure out.) By these we are mastered, the cruel taskmasters we both love and hate. They are our inner-progenitors of despair, of death. \n\tGod’s response to our need is as dire as our captivity. God pays our terrible ransom with the blood of sacrifice. This is why Jesus said, 'The Son of Man came... to give his life as a ransom for many' (Matt 20:28). It is why Paul says we 'were bought at a price' (1 Cor 7:23).\n\tPeter has the Passover lamb in mind when he refers to Christ being 'without blemish or spot' (Ex 12, Lev 22). As in the Passover, it is all about substitution—Jesus is the fundamental lamb of sacrifice, whose blood is the perfect replacement, absorbing the marks we bear from our masters and demons, whether physical, emotional, psychological, or spiritual. In his death and resurrection, God, in loving sacrifice, absorbs our wounds and gives new life.\n—Justin Holcomb"

Perhaps for you it was religious judgment, or an angry ex, or recent weight gain but, deep down, don’t we have a primary need that seems to get triggered by any sense of rejection?\n\tSometimes it is deserved, sometimes not—but all rejection in some form or another feels deserved. And life in fear of rejection can make paralytics of us all. \n\tOn the other hand, acceptance is sometimes deserved, but undeserved acceptance is God’s operating principle of grace. It somehow changes guilt into assurance and makes beauty out of ugly things. It strikes us when we are weak, not strong. It meets us in pain and restlessness. It meets us when we feel that our exclusion is deeper than usual, when our disgust at our exclusion has made us intolerable company. It meets us when longed-for progress does not appear, when old compulsions re-emerge, when despair destroys joy and courage. Grace has the uncanny ability to accept our most unacceptable moments. \n\tIn these darknesses, God says, 'Because of Jesus, you are accepted. You belong, to Me. You don’t need to try to do anything right now. Don’t seek after anything; don’t perform anything; don’t capitalize; don’t intend. Just be. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted.'\n\tOf course you are flawed and sinful and, most of the time, not that great of an investment! But you are more accepted and loved than you can know.

Parts of it, including the section at the end where Peter 'takes on' the teaching of St. Paul, are hard to read when you are in a Grace state of mind. But what might be there for us? \n\tLet’s say this: There is certainly nothing wrong with 'virtue,' and 'knowledge,' and 'self-control;' with 'steadfastness,' and 'godliness,' and 'brotherly affection,' and surely not with love. There is not one single thing wrong with these high integrities. \n\tWe took a trip not long ago to Israel, and also the West Bank, with our whole family. There were several moments of uncertainty—like when a church and site we had so longed to visit was closed. Or when a restaurant we really needed, for we were thirsty and hungry and exhausted, proved not to be in the place we had thought it was. (It materialized a quarter mile away and proved to be a high point, right down to the flakey torch-song by Celine Dion that was on repeat throughout the meal.) These were moments of serious uncertainty within an already uncertain Middle Eastern setting. And in each case of uncertainty, we came to a solution.\n \tThis is why virtues like steadfastness, not to mention self-control and knowledge, are devoutly to be praised.\n\tAnd, as Peter says in the eighth verse, they are expressions of fruitfulness and effectiveness. Faith without such 'works' is dead. Such works are the Chef’s signature 'blue plates!' When Christians are awful, and mean, and gossipy, and dress up self-righteousness as some kind of helpful advice, and compartmentalize their dark side, they show by this that they have missed the boat. The synapses are not connecting.\n\tThus I read this 'Law'-appearing text from St. Peter as simply a description of what happens in life. Faith results in virtue, with knowledge, and so on. These things are fruit, and they are sustaining.\n\tNow back to that Celine Dion hit. Hit? Just picture it: ten nice Americans in a restaurant on the West Bank—we are probably the first guests they have almost ever had—the waiter has to sprint out to the market around the corner to even buy the vegetables—we, the guests, are beyond starvation in July Holy Land heat—and Frau Celine is belting it out, on repeat, maybe 25 times for us (there is no one there to change the setting on the CD player back in the kitchen).

There is no long and no short, no Rip Van Winkle wakeup to the 'normal' way that time goes by, no 'Long Live Walter Jameson' coming to terms with ultimate mortality. (The reference is to an ancient episode of The Twilight Zone, in which a roguish academic lives for 120 years, only to confront in 1961 a wrinkled, worn former lover. Her anger at her ever youthful seducer does him in. He turns to dust on the floor!) God does not age! The Deity is apart from all passage of time. \n \tGod is not a part of time as humans measure it. I use the politically correct word 'humans' here, because we are now in the realm of sci-fi, where the big distinction is not between races and peoples, or men and women, but rather between earthlings and aliens. God is alien in this sense, for He does not relate in time.\n\tI think of the Time Traveler in H.G. Wells’ (and George Pal’s) immortal The Time Machine, in which the Rod Taylor character travels at least 25,000 years into the future, while his friends back in London wait on the night of December 31st, 1899 over after-dinner drinks for him to 'get back.' Yet, as you remember from that movie and novel, only love matters. The Time Traveler is finally uninterested in his speculations about time. He becomes un-obsessed by them. Instead, he becomes interested only in his true love, played by Yvette Mimieux in the film, and he gambles 26,000 years on her. All other preoccupations turn literally to dust.\n\tWhat I would hope to say about the metaphysical passage before us is that it is true. Conceptually, and in any world of reasoned speculation in which we might live, God is out of time. God has to exist out of time. Otherwise, He would not be God. Christians confess that God 'entered' time, in the Person of Christ; and that 'Incarnation' has made all the difference. But God as God must by definition exist out of time. So what do we know that is eternal that we can also still see in time? What exists among us now that is both in time and out of time?\n\tLove is the sure answer to that one. Love exists in the now, and love is the attainment of forever. It is the only thing that seniors want just as much as adolescents do. Love is what you want on your gravestone, and love is what you want for your infant grandson, and your adult daughter. Love, to quote St. Paul, never ends. It is why the Wells/Pal hero makes a completely satisfying decision, so far as the readers and the audience are concerned, when he chooses love over time, even if she is only to be found in the impossibly distant future. Love trumps time, trumps ontology, trumps physics, trumps metaphysics. Kerouac wrote, 'The Buddha—philosophy’s dreadful murderer.' I say, 'Love—time and eternity’s scythe.'\n—Paul Zahl"

		"text": "During my college years I worked in a genuine country 'general store.' It has long since closed, and even then it was a dying breed—selling everything from horse shoes to human shoes to hoop cheese to nails to fish hooks. But this store somehow held on, not really making any money, but remaining open due to the fact that the family that owned it kept it open in honor of the family patriarch, Mr. P, who had toiled in it for over 60 years. Mr. P’s health was failing, and at the time I worked there he was confined to his bed. His son had taken up the torch, but not with the same enthusiasm. Times change, but this little store in its day, I came to learn, had been part of the fabric of community life for four generations, and it was much more than a commercial venture.\n\tIn fact, many of the people I met there who came in to shop on the weekends, both black and white, came from Chicago or other big cities. They had moved away many years before, but came back to this store as a kind of pilgrimage because, as I learned in time, they had a lot of affection for Mr. P. They wanted to see if the store was still there and seemed to take great pleasure in just wandering around the place, sitting by the pot bellied stove and talking about how it used to be. \n\tDespite it not being the most efficiently run business, a few of the stories circulating told me why people came back to this little backwater place after 30 years, and it had nothing to do with nostalgia. Instead, every single one remembered some kindness that Mr. P had done for them 30 or 40 years before. In particular, I was told of a family that had fallen on hard times and had over time bought quite a lot of things, food and clothing and animal feed probably, from Mr. P on credit. While their account kept increasing, Mr. P never sent them a bill, but they knew what they owed, and it was a lot—more, in fact, than they could ever dream of paying. They were ashamed of this debt, and because they were ashamed they quit coming in to the store. After a while, Mr. P noticed that he had not seen them in some time, and he asked one of their neighbors if something was wrong. He was told that they felt bad that they owed this huge debt and they didn’t have the money to pay it, and that they couldn’t stand to come to the store and face Mr. P, and they surely were not going to ask for anything else 'on credit.' When Mr. P heard this, he promptly wrote them a letter telling them that whatever it was they owed, they didn’t owe it anymore, because he wanted to see them back at his store more than he wanted or needed money they didn’t have anyway.\n\tI think about that story whenever I read this passage from 1 John. Instead of 'consequences,' John offers his readers the promise of complete forgiveness, and even more than that, he offers them an Advocate for them as 'sinners' before the Father: 'But if anyone does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.' John says that we who are debtors are defended by the One who is righteous, by the one who has already paid every debt. Our defense is based on our debt being paid and cancelled by 'Jesus Christ the Righteous,' not on our promise and good intentions to pay in the future, or our excuses for not having paid in the past. Mr. P knew that the only way he was going to see the folks he loved again was if he absorbed and cancelled their debt. Thirty years later they were still coming back. \n\tJohn knew the same: God keeps us close to God, even in the midst of our failure and brokenness. He does this by the power of His unmerited grace in a way that no threat of judgment and no amount of fear-induced spiritual effort on our part could ever achieve. These are 'comfortable words' indeed.\n—Michael Cooper"

People need to straighten out their lives. People need more than touchy-feely sermons—they need ‘balanced’ preaching.' Crabbiness in overdrive; he was on a roll. It was a delightful meal. I listened to him, but I disagreed with him. I still do. The heart of the Gospel is God’s love, and God’s love is anything but 'balanced.'\n\t'Balanced' preaching has nothing to do with the Gospel.

At one point, I found myself with a group of high school students who were trying out an exercise called 'The Leap of Faith.' \n\tThis exercise involves climbing up to the top of a telephone pole, using big metal staples on the sides of the pole. The challenge is then to very slowly stand up on top of the pole, which at this point is some 30 feet off the ground and swaying back and forth. Then, the object is to shout 'three, two, one' and leap off the pole into space—and then, after the belay rope catches your leap, to enjoy the ride back down to earth.\n\tOne young woman gave it a try. She got halfway up the pole before coming back down. A bit later, she tried again. This time she got all the way to the top—and then climbed back down. She tried it one last time. She went up, managed to sit on top of the pole, and finally leaned forward and fell off it. Not a graceful leap of faith, exactly, but she did it.\n\tAs the belay rope lowered her, the others were cheering and clapping, and she had a big smile on her face. Then, as her feet touched the ground, and as her friends gathered around to hug her, she started to cry—and they were sweet, sweet tears. Her tears had nothing to do with making it up the pole. They had everything to do with trusting the rope and the belayer and all of us enough to give it a try. They had everything to do with the arms that awaited her as she came down. They had everything to do with being adopted, adopted into the strength and freedom and love of the family of Jesus Christ.\n\tThey had everything to do with—as the passage above says—God being greater than her heart.\n—Jim Munroe"

		"text": "This verse sums up 'in quintessence' (Squeeze) the two most important themes of the Bible:\n\tThe absolute otherness of God and the total accessibility of God through human love. That’s a big claim! \n\tBut think about it: St. John is struck by the inability of human beings to have eye contact with God. 'No one has ever seen God.' He is beyond human perceiving. Yet John insists that God is there, 'abiding' in us, when we love. Or rather, if we love. (Most of the time we don’t love but are 'looking out for number one.')\n\tWe might label this verse a 'liberal' sentiment. Ernst Käsemann told the story of a pretty tough Dutch layman, who once asked his minister the question, 'Is it possible, dominie, that Jesus may have been a liberal?'\n\tWhatever the right answer to that question is, this verse sounds 'liberal.' First, it seems to knock out the anthropomorphic idea—God is not corporeal in any way we could grasp. (John does state in the prologue to his Gospel: 'No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.' This means that the one clear window into God’s actuality would be the historical Jesus.) \n\tSecond, the verse locates God’s love within human love. 'If we love one another, God abides in us.' Love is horizontal. Or better, the only way to confirm the presence of God is to see whether people who talk about loving God are actually loving their neighbor.\n\tReligion is vertical, and probably so vertical that we start swaying when we get more than eight rungs up the ladder, and it just collapses with our trying. On the other hand, God is completely horizontal, in the here and now, when we find ourselves showing a little heart to our fellow sufferers.\n\t1 John 4:12 is a kind of ancient paraphrase of that show-stopping number from Damn Yankees, the Broadway musical, when the Washington Senators, down in the dumps but on the eve of their resurrection, sing: 'You gotta have heart.

		"text": "How strange, that faith is victory for a Christian. It is so small and entirely passive. It does nothing, but receives all in the form of a gift only by hearing. Faith, after all, is trust, and trust emerges not from within a person, but from outside. Trust depends upon another, not ourselves, and is called out from us by another making a promise. Trust is created in us by Christ making a promise. A promise is not yet seen, but faith is already, presently, actually created. This is why John does not say faith will be our victory one fine day; it is our victory already, right now, even though we have not yet seen what it will give. 'Faith is in things not seen,' after all, as Hebrews 11 says. \n\tShould we not then say that faith is Christ’s victory, not ours? That we perhaps look on and cheer Him to victory, but plainly the day belongs to Him and so the victory too? Christ is the Lord, is He not? Christ is the victor, and to the victor go the spoils. Justice, after all, as Aristotle teaches us, is that each keeps what is one’s own, and does not take what belongs to another. How, then, can we claim faith is our victory? \n\tA victory means an enemy is conquered; John says 'the world' fights against us. That is a rather formidable enemy indeed: death, the devil, and their one instrument for destruction, which is the Law of God itself. Yes, even though the Law is holy, right, and pure, it was misused specifically by faith. Faith came to trust the Law instead of Christ, and sought its righteousness through works of the Law instead of by faith in Christ alone. This engenders a great struggle for those of us who grow up like little children under the Law, as it always points out what we have not done. Trust in it begins to shout so loudly that we can’t hear anything else, and so we come to conclude that God is angry with us, and that somehow we need more time to get things right before our Lord comes for us. \n\tHowever, at the right time, God’s only Son was born to redeem those 'who were under the Law' (Gal 4:5). He brought the Law to an end by removing its power to judge us. In other words, 'He fought the Law, and the Law won.' But, when the Law won against its own Lord on the cross, calling Christ the greatest of sinners, the Law lost its accusatory curse upon sinners. Christ’s victory is to lose all, willingly, on the cross, though he is innocent and sinless. \n\tChrist’s victory becomes mine because, raised from the dead, he is now Lord of a new kingdom where there is no Law. Christ peoples this new kingdom with sinners whom he simply forgives. He chases the Law out of our consciences and replaces it with his own promise: 'I am pleased with you.' By this promise, Christ gives birth to faith in us who had lost faith, or put it in the wrong things. Faith is our victory because Christ ceases to be a Law-giver and becomes truly a redeemer who speaks the new word of forgiveness while we are yet ungodly. \n—Steven Paulson"

Knowing this, the world becomes less overwhelming, less surprising, and the momentary comforts you experience today can be held just as open-handedly as the discomfort you experience on another day. Our certainty lies not in the provisional promises that the world offers, because the world’s promises are not eternal. Instead, we can be certain in the knowledge that the Son of God has come, and it has overcome the unrelenting blows of a frenetic world.

		"text": "So often there’s a need to do something more with Christianity—to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, stop war, protect the environment, or even just let your spouse control the remote for the evening. In one sense, that desire to do something is a response to love, to the incredible gift of God’s forgiveness in our lives, and in that sense, it’s healthy. And it’s also extremely helpful to the world around us that suffers. \n\tHowever, when what we do becomes the test of what we believe, or the litmus of the sincerity of our faith—whether that test is in our own minds or is a judgment by others—we deal with something very, very different. In C.S. Lewis’ The Screwtape Letters, the diabolical Screwtape bemoans to his apprentice, Wormwood, the threat of Christians being 'merely Christian.' 'What we want,' he explains, 'if men become Christians at all, is to keep them in the state of mind I call ‘Christianity And.’' \n\tThe hard pill for our egos to swallow (but the only one that saves us) is that there is no 'And.' Christianity is not a moral code, a guide for living, or an agenda—it is a doctrine of belief that we need only abide in and take comfort in. It is a doctrine of belief in the work of one man and one man alone, who was God incarnate, Jesus Christ; and no one gets to the Father except through Him (John 14:6). Our good deeds are wonderful in that they help our neighbors, strengthen our relationships with one another, and maybe even stave off global warming (maybe). However, in terms of 'being Christian,' in terms of salvation, they are all completely after-the-fact, because 'It is finished' (John 19:30). All that is left is belief. \n—Leonard Finn"

		"verseText": "Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy...",
		"text": "In the Original Garden, blame is everywhere. After Adam and Eve sin, they try to hide from God. Guilt that rightly deserves blame makes you want to go into hiding. But God finds Adam and asks him if he has eaten the fruit of the forbidden tree. In response, Adam blame-shifts: 'The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.' He is unable to give God what every parent wants from his or her child: a straight answer. The man from whom we all inherit our immaturity and defensiveness not only blames the woman but also blames God! ('The woman whom you gave to be with me!') And if there weren’t enough denial and projection, the woman blames the serpent: 'The serpent deceived me, and I ate.' \n\tThe scene from Genesis constitutes the Original Blame Game, a game that has been played out at all times and in all places since. It is played out in marriages that finally break under the weight of blame, in families that fracture amidst cross-generational accusation, in cities whose inhabitants lay blame along racial lines, and among nations who blame a global crisis on a neighboring country’s ideology. \n\tWhere does blame actually lie? We have a favorite children’s book called David Gets In Trouble, by David Shannon. It’s the story of a boy named David who spends his day drawing on the living room walls, torturing the cat, burping at the table, breaking windows with baseballs and generally living the life of a mischievous boy. When David gets in trouble he always says, 'No! It’s not my fault!' Or 'I didn’t mean to!' Or 'It was an accident!' or 'No! It wasn’t me!' Most of us, whether we’re old or young, live David’s life, Adam’s life—getting in trouble, then shifting the blame. When we are honest, however, we know that the blame really lies with us.\n\tHow then could Paul say that we will be presented to God as blameless? Because the Bible says that all the blame-shifting in the world shifted finally to one man. Jesus Christ, the only blameless man, accepted the blame on our behalf. For our sake He who was without sin and without fault said on behalf of you and me, 'Yes! It is my fault. The blame stops here.' Because of Jesus Christ, those who trust in him are blameless forever.\n\tThe news of the One who took the blame is the news that will finally penetrate your defenses and end the blame game. At the end of David Gets In Trouble, David cries out in the dark of his room before going to bed, 'Yes! It was me! I’m sorry.' His mom comes in and lays her hand of blessing on his head. Happily, unburdened of his guilt, he says, 'I love you, mom.' His response of love is the response of all who know that Jesus has taken the blame. Yes, it was me, Lord. Thank you for taking my blame. I love You.\n—Paul Walker"

		"text": "No one likes being sick, especially if it involves nausea. If you’ve ever had to vomit, you know what I’m talking about. Jesus says of the church in Laodicea in verse 16 that, because they are neither hot nor cold (i.e. useless), he will spit them out. The Greek word translated as 'spit' can mean 'vomit.' Here is a church that has become so repellant as to warrant being vomited out of Christ’s mouth. What on earth could they have done to warrant such a grace-less judgment? \n\tThe Laodiceans were rich. Very rich. In fact, when an earthquake destroyed most of their city they didn’t need Roman federal funding—they repaired the city out of their own pockets. Verses 17-18 indicate that wealth had made them to think they needed nothing else, when, in reality, they were 'wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.' This church is thus standing in the ultimate seat of denial. Their perception of reality stands at odds with the foundations upon which their church was founded. But I’ll bet they had great self-esteem!\n\tIt is this self-centered, 'victorious' church that thus rejects its own Lord and consequently becomes useless (neither hot nor cold). This is a passage first and foremost of Law. It is a call to repentance in the face of judgment, not to the individual per se, but to the church. Ironically, and inappropriately, Revelation 3:20 is a favorite of evangelists: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.' In context, this is not a picture of Jesus knocking on the door of a bad boy’s heart, pleading for an altar run, but a picture of Jesus calling to a church that has kicked him out! But even if this did refer to an individual, could someone so supremely self-indulgent—like you and me—really have it in them to hear Jesus’ voice and let him in? The answer, I think, is no. And let’s be honest, how many of us know people who are not in church today because of something someone in the church did to them? 'I can’t go back there, not after what those women said to me when my marriage fell apart.'\n\tSo where is the Gospel in all this? Jesus says that those whom he loves he rebukes. While that sounds at first like a non sequitur, sometimes the only way the love of Christ steals into our hearts or into the church is by deconstructing the 'lies that bind.' Only then can the light of his grace and power be any comfort at all. Jesus is very bad-mannered in this door-knocking scene—but then again, wouldn’t it be more bad-mannered to leave us dead in our own house? I love this passage because it shatters tame versions of Jesus, and I love this passage because it tells me that Jesus has to shatter me in order for me to live. \n—Ben Phillips"

According to St. Peter, even the scientists will likely be surprised by the final day coming, as Peter says, like a thief in the night (2 Pet 3:7-12). Signs and wonders there will be, but Charlie Frost will not be broadcasting from the top of a mountain when all things flee before the throne of God, as He rolls back the heavens and the earth to make room for His court and the hearing of all the cases that have piled up since Adam and Eve took that which was not given them. \n\tRecently, simply the prospect of a few more degrees centigrade has been sufficient to make all mankind sweat, regardless of their zip code. On February 3, 2007, the headline of the Bild, Germany’s most widely read newspaper, proclaimed in bold letters over the backdrop of a sickly looking globe, 'Unser Planet stirbt!' ('Our Planet is Dying!'). What then of the prospect of not dying, but burning in a 'lake of fire?' And if that were not enough, then there are these books. \n\tHow many are there? St. John, the author of Revelation, does not say. Perhaps one for each of us—'The Book of the Deeds of Jamie?' Would a single massive tome cut it for you? How many printed pages would your internet cache  take? How many gigabytes would the video file of your whole life on CCTV be? According to St. John, it is going to get dicey, very dicey, for every one us. At least Dante left some wiggle room in The Divine Comedy; the noble pagans are given a castle in limbo, not subjected to the actual fires of the inferno. According to St. John the only place that our deeds are getting any of us is the lake of fire, a second, big death after our first, little death. \n\tOver against the books and the fire stands the book, a single one. It is not your book, nor mine, but our names may be written in it. It is the Lamb’s Book of Life, composed before the foundation of the world, in view of the culmination of the world (Rev 13:8). The book is his, and the names written in it are judged according to his, the Lamb’s, credentials, and destined for a long life with him and the Father in a new heaven and new earth, new creatures in a new creation. \n\tWhose names are in the book? More importantly, a pretty decisive question in the face of such hot judgment: 'Is my name in this Book of Life?' This gets answered by the baptismal waters of belief: 'I baptize you in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'—this is the decision of approval, 'signed, sealed, delivered.' To be in Christ is not to be headed for the lake of fire, but washed as a new creature in the new creation.

		"text": "I have a peculiar habit when it comes to reading The New York Times: I always skip sections A and B. I ignore International, National, and Regional, and head straight for the special-interest sections like Science, Food, Design, Arts & Leisure. It is only when I have exhausted the non-news articles that I turn to the 'real' news. \n\tWhy? Well, while the news may inform me of recent events and developments, it does not tell me anything new, really. It only reinforces what I already know, that the world I live in is in poor shape. The wars of this year, the hunger and violence and need—I already know them quite intimately. I find them in the pain I know and experience in my own immediate life. I am a world, a country, a region in strife: loss, conflict, sickness, sadness—these are the constants in this, our human situation. \n\tThis isn’t to say there isn’t real joy to be found, only that it is often not nearly as vocal as life’s difficulties. As the Jayhawks sing, 'Trouble, that’s what we had / And everything that goes around / Comes around in a bittersweet lament / Well my heart’s already broken down / Looking for a sweeter sound / Looking for a brighter day.'\n\tAgainst such a backdrop, this passage is a blast of fresh air. It tells us that this world and its tears will pass, that 'a brighter day' is coming. In pointing us to a future where there will be no tears, our tears in this broken world are made both legitimate and peaceably illegitimate. We can finally confront our pain, knowing that this world is not our answer, and that no matter how deep, senseless and unbearable the suffering we see and experience is, we are not terminally bound to it. \n\tSo, wherever you are, here it comes to you today, the vision of 'a new heaven and a new earth.' May it allow you to confront today honestly—may it also affirm you and comfort you. May it stir in you a hope and confidence that God is with you here, and that God is indeed trustworthy to make all things new.\n—K. Marc Choi"

On this side of heaven, we’re always going to need more money, more approval or prestige—and it all boils down to a need for affirmation, for self-worth, in light of our deep knowledge of our own failures, our limitation and guilt. And we pursue them by effort, earning and sacrifice. 'You’ve got to pay to play,' as the old saying goes.\n\tFortunately, we’re on the most solid ground in the world with our need. Early in his ministry, Jesus the physician claimed not to call the healthy, but the sick; not the righteous, but sinners. And even after Jesus’ work was 'finished'—even after God’s work in history is 'done'—it’s the thirsty who receive. We don’t magically become well because of Christ’s work on earth, and even after all things are made new, we remain the thirsty.\nWhat do we thirst for? Affirmation, belonging, solidarity, forgiveness—in a word, grace—and God himself gives 'living water' (Jn 4:10). Though our imperfect remembrances of God’s love and forgiveness will never fully set us at rest for 'the time being,' John’s picture of us enjoying His grace is of an infinite river where the thirsty find rest.\n\tThe word 'end' here means end of time, or climax, but it also means purpose, or goal. All of our strivings and failings and wants and needs are directed to this one—the endless grace of God, for us, without payment.\n—Will McDavid"

It came alive to my wife and me when we sailed to the island of Patmos a few years ago, and stood in the spot where John received his Revelation. The place is full of atmosphere, and it has a kind of aesthetic simplicity that sets it off from other holy places in that part of the world. Fewer icons and a contagious quiet.\n \tWhat is most visionary here, at the close of Revelation, is John’s extremely hopeful expression that the leaves of the tree of life are 'for the healing of the nations.' The apocalyptic vision does not concern rivers of blood (Enoch Powell), nor the lake of fire. That dismantling of 'what is' has, by this time in the Revelation, taken place. The smoke is now cleared. God’s final and enduring purpose, you might say, is for the first time glimpsed, 'beyond the horizon' (Bob Dylan). God’s purpose is benign. It is unconditionally and perfectly benign. God’s tree of life exists for the healing of the nations.\n\tWe were in Bethlehem recently, where the healing of the nations is definitely not taking place. The separation-wall constructed to seal the Palestinians 'in' and keep them 'out' is a sort of visual triumph of non-meekness, a quality that definitely seems to be inheriting the earth. It is 'theology of glory' over there, and the mourning, the hungering and thirsting, and the meek of the Beatitudes are getting no slack. 'Guns and Moses,' as the t-shirt says.\n \tFrom an 'All Things Must Pass' perspective (George Harrison), there is no way ultimately that the injustices inherent in that scene are going to triumph. Nothing in this world lasts, and this includes even the separation-wall. Go to Berlin! Checkpoint Charlie is now a giant souvenir stand. You would never for a minute know—unless you did—that World War III almost began there—literally almost began at that precise point—in 1968. Ultimately, the same thing will happen to the separation-wall, even if it is impossible to imagine it now. Read 'Ozymandias!' All things must pass—no exceptions.\n \tBut this final chapter says more. It is not just that injustice is transitory. No, injustice will be replaced by healed and healing reunion. Angry scars will be turned to baby skin. Inflammation will be replaced by softness. Division will be reunion. New Jerusalem will not just be absent of strife, but it will contain the beauty of refined feeling, the heart of sacrificing love, the mutual affect of compassion—what 'the world needs now' (Jackie DeShannon). 'Beyond the horizon' is a utopia of powerfully underwritten peace.\n\tThis is how the Bible ends. It ends not with a whimper.\n—Paul Zahl"
